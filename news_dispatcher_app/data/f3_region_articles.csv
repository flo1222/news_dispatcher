Bringing out a new watch of a high technological level during the crisis was a risky gamble. At the time of the assessments, the ""HD1 Open Heart"" allowed Humbert-Droz to overcome a very difficult year. ""It is time for this year 2020 to end, because we all want to quickly forget it"" we explains Julien Humbert-Droz, the young director of the family business created by his great-grandfather. Four generations at the head of this symbol of Bisontine watchmaking, and the fear at the height of the spring pandemic of not being able to overcome the crisis. The release of a new watch, the HD1 Open Heart will breathe new life into the brand and help it overcome difficulties. The company has acquired its letters of nobility in the manufacture of watches for prestigious brands as well as in the repair of high-tech watches. Reparalux has become a benchmark since 1956, but the pandemic has undermined more than fifty years of work. If the workshop never closed with the presence of management, production was completely stopped in a confined country and the staff put on short-time work. Working for its partners having become impossible, a solution had to be found in order to move forward. It was a question of survival. The company then bet everything on its creativity. First, there was the release of the R\xe9a Chrono in the spring to pay tribute to hospital staff. But Humbert-Droz is best known for the quality of his movements, and it was necessary to complete a project that Julien and his father had been thinking about for two years. Four years ago, the brand\'s first HD1 watch had a resounding success. Why not launch a reissue in 200 copies, this time with an open heart. A first for the watchmaker, but a risky bet at a time when the economy is at its worst. For this novelty, Humbert-Droz worked in partnership with the Bailly establishments in Besan\xe7on so that the Swiss ETA 2824 movement could appear for all to see. Very high-precision work which symbolizes Franche-Comt\xe9 watchmaking expertise recently listed by Unesco as a world heritage site.\r\nOne month after the release of this new model, the finding is clear. ""We took a risk with this open-hearted watch, but it turned out to be a winner! It is a crush on the amateurs who have followed us for several years. I was afraid during the first confinement for survival of Reparalux that my great-grandfather had created, and that my grandfather Jean and my father Fr\xe9d\xe9ric made prosper. No more orders, no more repairs. We were running into disaster. Today, I note with pride that it is our creations under the Humbert-Droz brand that have enabled the family business to save itself economically and morally by always moving forward. But the start of the year will be decisive and the activity should not have a third confinement which would be catastrophic for us ""explains Julien Humbert-Droz. Between stoppage of activity and partial unemployment, the workshop experienced its first three cases of Covid 19 at the end of October. The situation was quickly taken care of and fortunately the virus did not spread. All the more reason to leave Jean, the grandfather, far from the workshop. ""At 83, he continued to work, because watchmaking remains his passion. The days are long for him, explains Julien, his grandson to whom he handed over the reins of the family business, but we absolutely owed each other to protect it. With a very tight financial year 2020, 2021 risks being a year of transition. Nevertheless, if the creations systematically sold in limited and numbered special series continue to have a growth of 25%, Humbert-Droz will have to innovate again and meet the demands in order to continue in the veins of this open heart that will mark history. of the Bisontine company.

""Honestly, we do not understand why people can crowd into subways, RERs or supermarkets and we, in the open air, we are not allowed the right to exercise "", strongly regrets Roger Delpon, manager of Nikita sports, a ski rental and sale business in Bonascre in the town of Ax-les-Thermes in Ari\xe8ge."" We, for the distances, we are more at 80m2 than at 8m2! And on 6-seater chairlifts, we can only bring up 2 people. Ditto for queuing at the ski lift, it is managed. Same bitter observation for Jean-Claude Sarrat who manages Intersport stores in Peyragudes in the Hautes-Pyr\xe9n\xe9es. He believes that we followed Angel Merkel\'s decision, to the detriment of the mountain economy in France. ""But we are not in the same economic situation as Germany! We are much more fragile. But who does. the country? The people who work. We are in the process of making this country bankrupt. We have departments such as the Hautes-Pyr\xe9n\xe9es where the mountain economy drains the entire fabric from food, to buildings, through craftsmanship. And this as far as Tarbes "". The trader has the feeling of having a noose around his neck. ""After 53 years of existence, we are close to bankruptcy. There we are in the sales because we are at the end of the roll, we have to bring in money. But we tinker, we have no one. I have 15 people on short-time work and 15 that we were not able to hire at the beginning of the month who are dying. We no longer sleep at night in a situation like that "". Even if their stores remain open and they rent a few pairs of touring skis, the compensation is not up to par. For Jean-Claude Sarrat as for Roger Delpon, the turnover has dropped drastically. They estimate the fall to 80 to 90% compared to other years. ""Here in Peyragudes, we are two rental companies, continues Jean-Claude Sarrat. If we go bankrupt, the station is dead."" And it is not the PGE (loan guaranteed by the State) that reassures him. ""We are loaned but we will have to repay. However, if the situation takes hold, we will not be able. We are in the process of being redeemed in fact, the EMP is used for that"" he rebelled. The two professionals do not really believe in a resumption of activity, neither on January 7 as announced, nor in February. Roger Delpon pays himself a meager salary and his partner is on short-time working while waiting for the resumption ... But time is for regrets, ""especially since the snow is there and it is of exceptional quality!"" he soberly laments. '",False

The signing of this agreement will have consequences for the wine growers of Burgundy. The file has been open since June 2016. Four years later, this Thursday, December 24, the trade agreement between Great Britain and the European Union was signed. The victims feared a ""no deal"" which would have had serious consequences on the export of their wines. The English market is the most important after the American market: more than 16 million bottles exported in 2019. But today, professionals in the wine industry say they are reassured. Amaury Devillard is a winegrower on the estate of Ch\xe2teau de Chamiret, in Mercurey (Sa\xf4ne-et-Loire). Exports to England represent around 10% of its market. ""It\'s an important market because they are real connoisseurs. We have already been very affected by the Trump tax, then the restaurants closed here and at our neighbors."" The winegrower adds that 85% of his wines are produced for catering. While its sales have been strongly impacted since the confinement, Amaury Devillard feared the consequences of Brexit. ""In November and December, our importers anticipated the measures taken by Brexit and they made stock."" The trade agreement signed between the two parties decrees free trade, without tariffs or quotas on wine exports. It was precisely these customs duties that were of particular concern to the wine industry.As of January 1, 2021, Burgundy winegrowers as well as all French wine exporters to the British market will have to apply new customs formalities. Operation similar to that established with Canada. ""It will be at the administrative level that things will change for us"" confides St\xe9phane Briday, winegrower in Rully (Sa\xf4ne-et-Loire). They will surely ask us for additional papers or analyzes, which are not requested of us for the moment. It will be more expensive at the administrative level. St\xe9phane Briday underlines the lack of visibility. The whole industry is in the process of waiting. Across the Channel, professionals remain confident for now. Our English importers don\'t seem worried. They\'ve more or less had time to prepare, it\'s been going on for four years. For the winegrower from Rully, the English market is between 15 and 20 % of its annual sales. ""Our biggest customers [in England] are restaurants."" So for him too, the main worry at the moment remains the consequences of the health crisis before those of Brexit. The report by L. Malval, G. Talon and R.

Fewer people are leaving and those who used to go to the mountains prefer other destinations, such as Brittany and its seaside. If the French have favored Brittany this summer for their holidays, it is always the case for the end of year celebrations. Difficult to escape abroad, to go ""too far"", Brittany is on the rise and is on the podium of the favorite destinies of the French for the end of year celebrations. In the streets of Saint-Malo this weekend, ""there are a lot of people"", confirms Laurence Bozzuffi, director of the tourist office of the Cit\xe9 Corsaire. No museum, no cinema or other cultural activities, holidaymakers opt for nature vacations, in the great outdoors. People come for a breath of fresh air, a change of horizon. They need escape, says Laurence Bozzuffi. Even if the clientele is less present than in previous years, she says that vacationers are there. A trend confirmed by Anne Gallo, vice-president, responsible for tourism in the Brittany region. Brittany is a popular region during the end of the year celebrations, families often come back for Christmas, for short holidays.

According to a survey by PAP, the real estate site of Particulier A Particulier, it is indeed the closure of ski lifts in the mountains that is in favor of the coast. As a reminder, the government has decided to close the ski lifts at least until January 7. This closure is very beneficial to Brittany. And, in my opinion, it is many inhabitants of the Parisian agglomeration who have decided to postpone their choice towards Brittany and Normandy. I do not think that it is the Ni\xe7ois who go up to Brittany , explains to Telegram, Corinne Jolly, president of PAP. Indeed, according to PAP, the mountain is usually the main destination of the French for the Christmas holidays. But this winter, the mountain has gone from 56% of bookings in 2019 to 36% this year. Conversely, the sea went from 33% to 48% of reservations.\r\nWith the restaurants closed, it is another mode of vacation that the French choose. Vacationers prefer residences to rent, lodges rather than hotels. Indeed, with the restaurants closed, it is not easy to prepare the meal and get together with family. Among holidaymakers, there is a bit of everything, people who have second homes, but also those who have booked lodges and apartments, confirms Laurence Bozzuffi, director of the tourist office of the Corsair City. According to the PAP study, the French coast is an astonishing postponement destination for these Christmas holidays.

The objective of positions to be eliminated in France is exactly 4248. This figure is that established by the management of Airbus in order to best face the health and economic crisis linked to the Covid-19. 6 months after the launch of its social plan, the European aircraft manufacturer is on the way to achieving its goal. According to our information, the Nantes and Saint Nazaire sites have reached the bar that had been set for them, without any forced departure. 484 positions for the first, 386 for the second. A result obtained with a hard fight by the unions after long sequences of negotiations with the management of Airbus. Trade unions have succeeded with the help of several mechanisms, such as the APLD (long-term partial activity), CORAC funds for research and innovation, early retirement or for business creation, avoid the zero dry layoffs they demanded.

The Ministry of the Sea has unveiled several support measures for fishermen and wholesalers after the announcement of a post-Brexit trade agreement between London and the European Union. Europe will also offer other aid. Pierre Karleskind was the guest of our news on Friday evening on this point. Pierre Karleskind is a Member of the European Parliament and Chairman of the Brussels Fisheries Commission, he is also a regional advisor for Brittany and a trained oceanographer. He was the guest of France 3 Bretagne\'s newscast on Friday evening. In the words of Pierre Karleskind, ""A balanced, sustainable and long-term agreement for fisheries"": that was the mandate of Michel Barnier, the European negotiator of the post-Brexit trade agreement which ended on December 24, 2020. An almost free trade agreement subject to compliance with European environmental and social standards in particular, an agreement which remains to be ratified by the States in the weeks to come. The MEP will also wait until he has read the 1,500 pages of the agreement before qualifying it as a good agreement or not ""because the devil is hiding in the details"". Anyway adds Pierre Karleskind ""good deal or not, Brexit is bad for everyone, for us and for the British"".\r\n""Initially the English asked us to reduce fishing by 80%, [in their waters Editor\'s note] recalls Pierre Karleskind, it was a good part of European fishing that was on the ground! To achieve this result of less 25% with in addition, five and a half years to get there, and we can say that Michel Barnier negotiated well for Europe. ""The post-Brexit agreement on fisheries therefore provides for a transition period of five years, until summer 2026, for fishermen in the European Union (EU) to gradually give up 25% (in value) of their annual catches in British waters, whereas it was a historic right to fish there before the constitution Europe. 25% reduction in fishing in British waters is still a quarter of 650 million euros per year. In other words, the European negotiators have conceded the British more than 150 million euros of fish on what they are currently selling to European fishmongers in our auctions. At the end of this period, the agreement provides for an annual renegotiation with the British, a vagueness on which the Minister of the Sea returned this Saturday morning to France Inter.\r\nThis Saturday morning on France Inter, the Minister of the Sea Annick Girardin estimated that the Brexit agreement would cause ""a bit of damage"" among French fishermen ""but that the State will accompany them."" ""We are missing out. of a disaster which would have been either a no deal, or the English claims which were 80% of the quotas that we had to return "", underlined the minister, evaluating at"" 171 million euros ""the French fishing share"" with our British neighbors ""every year.\n\r\n""So 25% less, about 42 million, of course, they will be missing. That is why there is this plan to support the budget and exit the fleet, support for restructuring and training of those who will leave this sector. Yes there will be a little breakage, but yes the state will be there, ""she said again.\r\nAs for the quotas negotiated with the United Kingdom, they ""will not budge"", insisted the minister. ""They are recorded. On the other hand, the accesses ... in five and a half years, the United Kingdom could decide to close these In this case, of course, we have provided for very harsh sanctioning measures: we too can close our waters, we can remit taxes on products, fishery products but more generally (... We are going to learn to work differently, including with our neighbors in the United Kingdom "", underlined Mrs Girardin.\r\nWe measure the constraint for certain European fleets like that of the Netherlands, which are losing large fishing grounds in the North Sea.

On farms, slaughtering began three days ago and will continue throughout the week: 40,000 ducks from 25 farms will be killed.

Rather than systematic slaughter, the president of Modef in the Landes believes that it would have been necessary ""to stop all traffic from the first case"".

There was breakage in all countries, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Belgium ""he lists. ""Vaccination could have saved local production.""

""It is all the more regrettable"" adds Serge Mora that ""it is a production which has no problem of outlets and which lacks production"". The Modef and the peasant confederation advocate targeted slaughter and ask for tests to spare healthy palmipeds.

""We cannot continue to work like that"" warns Serge Mora: I worked for 35 years, until 2015 without any worries. I do not understand that today, we have repeated crises of this level.

Located in Blanzat, near Clermont-Ferrand, the company Cr\xe9light Illuminations has just provided the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital with the light sets it manufactures. Set up from December 15 to January 15, the lights are visible on the forecourt of the CHU Estaing but not only. Alexandra Pichand, manager of the company with her husband, says: Given the health crisis, we wanted to provide sets to bring a little light to the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital. The hospital was asked to decorate the pediatric wards and illuminate the forecourt. We also wanted to decorate the Louise-Michel hospital, which welcomes seniors. The manager explains: On the forecourt of the CHU Estaing, there is a big star, the star ball, a luminous structure, completed by two trees. There are also characters, gingerbread, clown, snowman, that are inside. There are also two sets in front of the pediatric emergency room. We wanted to help provide our support.

We can also offer machines through already well-established partnerships. We do projection but not mapping. We are able to offer tailor-made projects to communities, to the shopping centers with which we work.

In the Puy-de-D\xf4me we are the only ones to manufacture. We can also provide all the after-sales service afterwards . The decorations are 100% with LED. It uses 95% less energy than an old lighting system. It lowers the energy note. All the raw materials are recycled: ""It is aluminum that can be recycled endlessly,"" says Alexandra Pichand. According to her, For local authorities, it is important to work with a local actor and to work with a reactive company, which knows how to put itself in the place of its customer, to establish a relationship of trust over time.

Fishing was the final sticking point in the discussions. So what is the nature of the negotiated compromise, what do those concerned think? In recent days, the teams of negotiators led by David Frost for London and Michel Barnier for Brussels, have been fighting only for the issue of access for European fishermen to British waters. Fishing represents only a tiny part of the British economy, but the issue serves as a symbol of sovereignty for Boris Johnson.Highly dependent on British waters, fishermen in several European states could not accept losing their quotas. allocated historically. These fish-bearing waters represent 30% of the turnover of French fishermen. Lorient, Boulogne-sur-Mer, and Le Guilvinec are the most affected. Around 100 Breton offshore vessels have adapted their investments to fishing methods for fish species taken from British waters, with negotiations focused on sharing the some 650 million euros of products caught each year by the EU in British waters and the length of the adaptation period for European fishermen According to AFP, citing European and British sources: the European Union will transfer to the United Kingdom 25% of the value of the products caught in British waters by European fleets, at the end of a transition period running until June 2026, as part of the post-Brexit agreement.\r\nThis reduction in catches, estimated in value and not in tonnage, would be gradual and would ultimately represent 8% to 10% loss of turnover for French fishing.\n\r\nIn addition, still according to the agreement announced on Thursday, EU fishermen will maintain guaranteed access until June 2026 to areas located within 6 to 12 nautical miles off the British coast (territorial waters) where they were going. traditionally.\n\nDuring the transition, ""this access will remain as it is today. Afterwards, it will be subject to annual discussions,"" explained a European official. Finally, after this period of five and a half years, the access of European fishermen will be renegotiated every year, according to a UK government document summarizing the deal. In practice, the agreement ""allows a considerable increase on the part of British fishermen, equivalent to 25% of the value of European catches in British waters,"" says the Downing Street document.\r\n""We can only be relieved and I would like to underline the work of the EU with Michel Barnier.

Many opponents have come forward. The Prefect of the Allier will have to decide next spring. They are higher than the Montparnasse Tower: the highest wind turbines in France and almost in Europe could soon emerge from the lands of Bourbonnais. At Bransat and Laf\xe9line, this project is under study. A public inquiry started on December 11 and is due to end in mid-January. But the project led by the ABO Wind company raises many concerns. Anne de Bony, lawyer, is inexhaustible on the file. It is directly affected by the location of the wind turbines: ""I own a house 700 meters from the project. I am opposed to this project not because I don\'t like wind turbines, that\'s not the reason, it doesn\'t make sense. I think this project will not bring green energy. The purpose of wind turbines is to decarbonise. However, we are in a very little windy area. Since there is not enough wind, they are forced to put wind turbines 241 meters high for this to work. This is already a first aberration. We can install wind turbines but destroy a landscape, an abundant fauna seems to me illusory. I find that quite unacceptable. ""The lawyer continues:"" We are in the midst of migrating birds, common cranes. They are very sensitive to vibrations, and they will throw themselves into the blades. It is a protected species. We also have royal kites around our home. It is also a protected species, including at European level. There are probably places where you can do things with more discernment. In Bransat there are also 17 species of bats. They are also threatened . These huge wind turbines will impact farming. Around the project there are meadows. There is a stall 600 meters away. It is known that cows abort or no longer produce milk near wind turbines. I am afraid for these farmers who will lose everything, says Anne de Bony. She also points to the danger posed by proximity to a gas pipeline. Finally, she adds: The wind turbines are so big that they will have to dig and put 9,000 tons of reinforced concrete, concrete and jail, to seal the wind turbine. It pollutes the earth. Wind turbines are obviously not going to work a lot, maybe 20%. Its ridiculous after all. Anne de Bony is hoping for an extension of the public inquiry by a week or 15 days. The investigating commissioners will issue a report and give a favorable or unfavorable opinion. The last word will go to the Prefect of Allier, no doubt in the spring. Bransat is one of the wine-growing municipalities of the AOC Saint-Pour\xe7ain appellation. Fabien Malavaud is president of the conservatory of old grape varieties but also a technician of the winegrowers\' union. He explains: The AOC has taken a stand against the project, especially in relation to wine tourism. We care about our hedged landscapes and we rely on them to develop tourism. We are a small appellation that deserves to be known. Planting 6 wind turbines 240 meters high is really shooting yourself in the foot. It is a disproportionate project in the heart of the vineyard "". He said: On Monday, December 14, the board of directors of the Saint-Pour\xe7ain winegrowers\' union voted and issued an unfavorable opinion on the project. The union represents 39 cooperative members and 20 cellars. Would we put these wind turbines in Versailles, in Chambord? Another fervent opponent of the project, Eric Beaumont, representative of the SPPEF (Society for the Protection of Landscapes and Aesthetics of France). He says: ""I have dedicated my life to heritage and I am outraged by the coming massacre of the landscapes: potentially, there are 100 buildings affected. This is unheard of in France. The wind turbines will be 240 meters high. The measuring mast, which was 125 meters, was visible for 25 km around.

The National Orientation Council for Animal and Plant Health Policy recommended a slaughter on Wednesday evening massive poultry around the two outbreaks detected in Chalosse last weekend.

For example, the head of the Association of Cable Car Operators also sits in the parliament for the center-right People\'s Party (OeVP) of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. In the western province of Tyrol, skiing is one of the main economic drivers , with six million skiers flocking there normally each year, roughly eight times the local population.Without tourists, many resorts believe that maintaining slopes and operating ski lifts would not be economically viable, and some, like Ischgl, choose to open only a small part of their cable car and ski lift network. Following last season, shortened by the pandemic, resorts have invested millions of euros in disinfection devices for cable cars, masks for skiers and apps that make it easier to dispatch skiers to avoid crowds. announced that it had invested 700,000 euros for anti-Covid-19 security measures.

His name is David, he is a truck driver for Mesguen transport in Finist\xe8re, and he is therefore stranded in England.

Objective: to invest locally in renewable energies. Let the sun shine in! This is what the Bourges Plus agglomeration wants to do, which has just launched a solar cadastre of its territory on December 17, which can be consulted online. A cadastre with one objective: to develop the use of photovoltaics, or the production of electricity by converting solar energy. Its interface presents a beast seen from the sky, on which all the roofs are colored in shades of yellow. The more the yellow pulls on the bright, the more the sunshine is strong, and the more it pulls on the brown, the less interesting it becomes to put a solar panel. Once his house is located on the map, any individual can activate the simulator and "" assess the economic and environmental opportunity to install solar panels ""on its roof, according to the agglomeration. The cadastre was developed by the startup In Sun We Trust, a young company specializing in the comparison between the different installers of solar panels . Its primary objective was ""to prevent customers from scams, and to facilitate access to solar energy for the French,"" explains the company\'s development manager, Antoine Ebel. Quickly, the idea of the cadastre arrived , in order to appeal to communities and include as many French people as possible in the process. The cadastre is produced by the conjunction of two databases: After a calculation step - ""several months for each community covered"" - the cadastre is posted on a dedicated site, stamped with the logo of the community covered. In five years of existence, In Sun We Trust has established partnerships with 80 French communities, and their cadastres cover 12 million inhabitants. Of these two communities, only two are in Center-Val de Loire. The first to have tried the experience is the Touraine-Est Vall\xe9es community of municipalities, in Indre-et-Loire, equipped since December 2019. Before being joined by Bourges Plus at the end of the year. of the Berruy\xe8re agglomeration is simple: ""multiply by 40 [the] production of renewable electricity"" in the territory. Currently, only 0.3% of the energy consumed there is produced by solar. However, according to the Bourges Plus Territorial Air Energy Climate Plan, the production potential by photovoltaic solar energy would be enough to cover a third of the territory\'s consumption, a figure that will not be reached in the years to come, and which is not even posted as an official objective by the agglomeration. Bourges Plus estimates, on the other hand, that 40% of its energy consumption comes from housing. The solar cadastre then appears as an aid, to make housing more autonomous in energy, clean moreover. A tool to encourage but which is not yet sufficient in itself, as Antoine Ebel of In Sun We Trust acknowledges: It is reliable for a pre-feasibility study. But we must not say to ourselves: ""I am told so much production, I sign"". It requires a verification with photos and a technical visit on the spot to be sure that we pass by next to something, such as a tree or a building that has grown since the last passage of the IGN plane, and which would add Antoine Ebel, Head of Development at In Sun We Based On it is still far too early to assess the effectiveness of the system in Bourges, Antoine Ebel acknowledges that, in one year, the cadastre of Touraine-Est Vall\xe9e has received ""relatively few visits"". ""We are at the bottom of the wave, especially because of the confinement"", he believes, preferring to focus his ""hopes for 2021"". At the beginning of its history, In Sun We Trust poached communities to offer them a flamboyant land registry new. ""Today, our reputation precedes us, and it is they who come to ask us."" But at present, no other community in the Center-Val de Loire has approached the startup. ""People are fed up, because many get at least one solar panel canvassing call every week.""

In particular, the closure of tourist sites and the limitation of large family reunions, traditional during the end of year celebrations.According to the department of Indre-et-Loire, the lodgings of the Center-Val de Loire are not housed in the same boat. For the last two weeks of 2020, a catastrophic year for the sector, many lodges and bed and breakfast in the region show a significant drop in attendance, while others remain afloat, mainly geographic disparities. France Bleu Orl\xe9ans and France Bleu Berry indeed report that the Loiret has seen its lodgings fill up for the Holidays, as usual, while attendance in the Indre is even increasing compared to the same period in 2019. Reservations encouraged by the end of travel restrictions, and by the desire, for many city dwellers, to go green. In the Loir-et-Cher, further from Paris than the Loiret, attendance seems to be maintained. ""Overall, we are a little below compared to 2019 reservations"", explains the president of G\xeetes de France du Loir-et-Cher, Elodie Colonna de Leca. A decrease that she considers insignificant, ""with an equivalent turnover"". Elodie Colonna de Leca also notes that ""the reservations were rather spread out over time"", and that ""there was no \'cancellations\'. A situation opposite to that observed by Fabienne Houdayer. According to the head of G\xeetes de France Touraine, reservations in Indre-et-Loire were made ""at the rate of government announcements, at the last minute"", with a larger share than usual for stays of less than a week. Results: the lodges and guest houses in Touraine recorded a drop in the number of reservations of around 14% compared to the end-of-year holidays in 2019. ""There will be 37% occupancy at Christmas and 48% on the day of the year, ""notes Fabienne Houdayer, considering that more than a third of the 730 lodgings in Indre-et-Loire are closed this winter. ""In this context, with the uncertainty at the end of the curfew, it could have been worse"", she adds, specifying that these two weeks are traditionally ""important for open lodgings, which charge a low price. slightly higher than the rest of the year "". And especially for the best equipped lodgings which usually benefit from family reunification during the holidays. But this year, with government recommendations for a maximum of six guests at the table, large gatherings are much rarer, and ""large lodgings are therefore having more trouble this year,"" says Fabienne Houdayer. Fortunately, the Center-Val de Loire retains a geographical location which ""facilitates gatherings"", according to the manager of the lodgings of Indre-et-Loire: Tours and Touraine are places often chosen because people from all over France can meet there at halfway, in the center of France. Children who are in the south, parents in Brittany and cousins from Paris Fabienne Houdayer, G\xeetes de France manager for Indre-et-Loire But, geographically further from Paris, Indre-et-Loire seems to have less took advantage of the arrival of Parisians, such as the Loiret, with an aggravating factor: the closure of the castles. ""Holidaymakers were waiting to see if the tourist sites were going to open, but that was not the case"", regrets Elodie Colonna de Leca, with the consequence of a lack of last minute reservations in Loir-et-Cher. Loir-et-Cher and Indre-et-Loire are the two departments of the Center-Val de Loire most dependent on tourism linked to the Loire chateaux, which two weeks ago hoped to welcome people for the Holidays. And the government\'s decision to keep them closed after the end of confinement on December 15 was hard to take. Usually, ""we refuel thanks to Christmas at the castles"", recalls Fabienne Houdayer. So inevitably, without castles to visit, tourists fans of heritage desert Touraine and Loir-et-Cher. A combination of factors that does not only make people unhappy.

Lyon announced in mid-November an upcoming strengthening of the Low Emissions Zone (ZFE) currently in force in Lyon and Villeurbanne for vehicles transporting goods. In particular, it is planned to extend it to individuals by authorizing only the circulation of Crit\'Air 0 and 1 stickers by the end of the mandate, which would exclude diesel engines.\r\n\nBruno Bernard, who also chairs Sytral, the Lyon public transport management body, has repeatedly stressed that this measure - contained\r\nin its electoral program - would be accompanied by large investments in alternatives to the car (bicycle; metro, bus and tram; car-sharing and carpooling) and a support system for the acquisition or use of low-cost vehicles. emissions. ""Our goal is that in the long term the vehicle fleet is both reduced and depolluted"" explained the elected ecologist after a recent meeting of the ZFE steering committee.\n\r\nAn announcement which does not surprise Yves Carra, spokesperson for the ""Automobile-Club Association"", but which he finds archaic: ""In 20 years, long before this environmental wave, manufacturers have made enormous progress in diesel or gasoline cars. And today, the depollution of a diesel means that some of these vehicles could have a crit\'air sticker.1 But, because S\xe9gol\xe8ne Royal issued a decree a few years ago, we do not have one. The law is already a first discrimination whereas today the diesel car - for the most recent models - does not emit more polluting emissions than a gasoline car. "" he explains. According to this national association, it is an unfair decision for some of the inhabitants ""Today, the share of the oldest diesel, which come to town, is minimal. So, we are getting there: we forbid diesels in Lyon in 6 years. That means hundreds of thousands of people who will no longer come to Lyon. These are the most modest households, who will feel excluded, and will not take public transport. So: to desert the shops city centers and to supply the large shopping centers on the outskirts of the city centers, there is nothing better! ""\r\n\r\n""Behind this apparent good-thinking, it is in fact a segregation of the populations by the money which looms"", judge for his part Pierre Chasseray, general delegate of the association ""40 million motorists"", for whom he It is about an ""environmentalist bidding"" at the expense of the most modest households. ""Because prohibiting the circulation of old cars and those considered polluting, it is to prohibit the access of cities to the most modest households who have neither the means to buy a recent electric or thermal vehicle, nor to live in downtown, he continues. The association deplores that this objective is set by Bruno Bernard, EELV president of the metropolis of Lyon, ""at a time when the pollution control bodies for thermal vehicles have never been so efficient and where the ecological taxation imposed by the government worsens the precariousness of the poorest households "".\r\nIt\'s easy to always bang on cars.Yves Carra, Automobile Club Association spokesperson\n\r\n""The elected environmentalists of Greater Lyon, like those of the City, explain that we must invest heavily in public transport, and they are right."" adds Yves Carra, from the Automobile-Club Association. ""But it is very expensive. However, we realize, in 2020 that, in metropolises like that of Lyon, there is a huge deficit in these structures because people no longer borrow them. You should know that with the Covid, we have seen a massive shift towards the car (70%) and not the bicycle (30%). "" For him, the decisions of elected environmentalists are not balanced enough: ""We must obviously fight against all pollution: polluting emissions, dioxide, monoxide, co2, fine particles, plastic ... But we can not blame the car systematically for each episode of pollution, whatever it is. There can be pollution alerts even when there are ten times fewer vehicles, as in Paris. It\'s easy to always bang on the cars. C It is more complicated to address the plastics factories, the farmers Lets not forget that we have a chemical valley close to Lyon. Its also pollution.

Regarding passenger transport, ""it\'s flat electroencephalogram,"" comments the president of Brittany Ferries. He estimates that the company has lost more than half of its turnover, which in 2019 amounted to 463 million euros. Despite the current interruption, Jean-Marc Rou\xe9 is more optimistic regarding the freight part of the activity. ""We are not going to cut off food for 70 million people across the Channel!""

Largely financed by donations from the faithful during religious services, many parishes of the Somme found themselves in difficulty. ""The older ones are cautious, notes Father Ledieu, abbot of the parish of Saint-Martin in Amiens. We see them less in this moment"". On the morning of Sunday, December 19, the nave of the church seemed to be full. The reception capacity has increased from 650 people before the health crisis to 280 in this building located on the heights of the city. After a gauge initially set at 30 by the government, places of worship can accommodate more the faithful since December 3. According to a strict health protocol: two seats must be free between each person or family group and only every other row can be occupied. This imposed drop in attendance at religious services has consequences on the revenues of the parish: fewer worshipers at Mass means less money given during the collection. ""A Sunday quest brings life to a parish but also the diocese. It allows the priests of the diocese to live, who live only on the generosity of the people, but also to pay the salaries of the employees of the Church,"" specifies Father Ledieu. It is also used for the catechism books, the maintenance of the rooms, the heating. And the quest, it also becomes help to the most precarious "". And the still sparse ranks of the church are a reflection of the finances of the diocese of Amiens. Its revenues fell by 40%, with an estimated loss of 500,000 euros in 2020. ""The only resource for churches and parishes is the generosity of the faithful, confirms Claude Gautier, Bursar of the Diocese of Amiens. This generosity. manifests itself mainly when communities come together for Sunday Masses, weddings, baptisms ... If the communities do not come together, necessarily, this will have consequences since the opportunities to make offerings and participate in resources do not exist. There will be fewer resources at the end of the year for the parishes. "" A situation of which the faithful are well aware: when it comes to financially supporting their parish, their generosity is blatantly coming back this Sunday to attend Mass. Numerous and generous when it comes to supporting their parish. ""If we don\'t give, I don\'t see how the priests could continue to live and the churches to function. This is all the more important since there have been very few Masses and therefore very little collection. C \'is essential, ""confirms a parishioner at the end of the service. ""We participate in our measure, explains a father of a family. We go to Masses so it is normal that we give the priests the financial means to make Mass"". In his blue cassock striped with golden threads, Father Ledieu admits being ""impressed"" by the commitment of his parishioners ""who compensated for the time of the confinement in a way that surprised us all. By the quests but also by concrete gestures of sharing food for the precarious"". generosity which will nevertheless not be enough to cover the deficit. The diocese is therefore considering making cuts in spending. And it is the restoration work in particular that is likely to suffer: ""we wonder about certain operations: will they be completed? In the same proportions as initially imagined? According to the same schedule?"", explains Claude Gautier. If the religious services continue, at the present time no relaxation of the sanitary rules is planned to welcome more faithful. ""In many parishes, budgets are already tight, Claude Gautier saddens. There are some reserves but generally, they are mobilized for major work and not for daily operation. If we draw on our reserves, for some parishes the end of the year will be difficult. ""With a broad smile that can be seen behind his mask, Father Ledieu sees this crisis with a form of fatalism:"" yes, there will certainly be financial difficulties. But that\'s normal. that we are not immune to difficulty or even misfortune like others. I think it is our place to be alongside others. And I am not particularly in fear and worry.

""The subject has been on the table for a few years, but things have intensified since September and the successive meetings of the CSE, but the dialogue is unilateral"", indicates Yannick Smit. According to the FO union representative, the establishment of this system monitoring is justified by management on the basis of ""quality control on its production line"". The management of Vandemoortele denies wanting to control its employees. ""Except that the staff wonders, and that creates an anxiety-provoking climate,"" said Yannick Smit. ""General increase in salaries of 5%, full 13th month after one year of seniority, monthly payment for overtime at 125% "", these three demands are also among the reasons for the call to strike.

Painful and disturbing for many of us, it was especially trying for Patrice Le Cain. At 50, this former transport executive chose to become an oyster farmer and settled in Bouin, in Vend\xe9e. A real adventure, we are in the Bouin marshes, in Vend\xe9e, in the Polder des Champs. An oyster farm set up behind the levee, on the other side, there is the Atlantic Ocean. Dozens of oyster farmers' huts surrounded by stalls and ponds. So many tractors and flatbed trailers, ready to hit the sea. The inter-holiday is a special moment. The big blow for Christmas is over, but there is still New Year's Eve. And what New Year's Eve! The 2020 model promises to be unprecedented as the health regulations in force have condemned the population to celebrate the New Year at home and not at restaurants or nightclubs. And oysters, in all of this? Well, they are doing well and so are their producers! The French are ready to make some sacrifices, but not all of them, and especially not to give up oysters. You have to take bridge n \xb0 6 to cross the level and count the huts until the fourth to arrive at Patrice Le Cain. An icy wind blows over the nearby wind farm and the ponds. Not many people in sight, the oyster farmers are inside, and Patrice is no exception. He prepares his basket of oysters n \xb0 3, the most requested commercial size. About fifty packages have to be prepared.\r\nAnd magic rhymes with supersonic! Patrice Le Cain has been going through the last few months at about this speed. Imagine: two and a half years ago, this executive specializing in transport moved to Pornic with his family. There he meets oyster farmers who become friends and, one day, take him for a ride on their oyster bed in Bourgneuf Bay. The blood of this Breton fisherman's son only turns, the virus of the trade. is inoculated on the spot, impossible to escape! After 20 years of work as a charterer for a large refrigerated transport company radiating at European level, that is to say after twenty years of struggle against the competition, Patrice had undoubtedly covered the question. Manager, he had a good job, a good salary, but no doubt something was missing.\r\nWe can imagine the days and nights to think about in the face of such a dilemma: staying in the comfort of a well-established framework or marrying this profession which thrills but which is subject to the vagaries of weather, climate and health? lives as a couple with two children, it's called an adventure.

Because dad already exercises it, or someone in the family. Because we live very close to an oyster farming area and often come across tractors, boats, vans, trucks, because we love the sea, and then there are those who have the revelation later . Patrice Le Cain has taken several steps: find a concession to sell, find training in the profession of oyster farmer, find training to navigate professionally. For young people, several vocational schools offer training. The CAP maritime Shellfish farming constitutes the basic training. It qualifies workers capable of participating in all oyster and other shellfish farming operations.After the CAP or directly after the 3rd, two professional vats allow to deepen knowledge and know-how, and to take more responsibilities. The Marine Cultures pro vat focuses on shellfish and also saltwater fish and algae. Baccalaureate in hand, motivated graduates can study the subject in depth in BTSA Aquaculture. For adults, it is possible to follow an intensive training course. This was the choice of Patrice who followed a course of 280 hours in Etel, in Morbihan. Then, it was necessary to obtain different degrees of professional navigation license, worker 1, worker 2, then boss. The oyster farming concession is a space granted by the state on the seafront where the professional of the sea can exercise his profession and install his production tools: basins, hut, tractor, graders, washers, etc ...

It is this last choice that Thomas Maurice makes: this winter, he will acquire a patou (a Pyrenean Shepherd), to protect his goats. ""It brings a form of serenity, a clear protection against predators. It is also a cost to assume, but which is partly financed by the State. It must also be a good dog, so that it has a good breeder, and endowed with a good education "", explains the breeder. A choice that the breeder must assume, and which requires a lot of time:"" The patous farms are located in the Alps and in the Pyrenees. you still have to go there to find the right dog.

From Breil-sur-Roya to Tende, in the Roya valley, essential businesses are gradually reviving. And the residents are responding. This Tuesday morning, the Tendasques are lining up on the snowy sidewalk, in front of the bakery in Tende (Alpes-Maritimes). The establishment reopened on November 5, after five weeks of forced shutdown, and has even diversified.

Precise, fixed schedules, which lead to new behaviors, as in the Breil-sur-Roya supermarket.

His business had to close five days after Storm Alex. In the weeks that followed, the activity sometimes struggled to resume, competing with the many donations sent to the victims. The products that went out first, it was fresh products (especially cheese and meat). could not be given. For dry and household products (groceries, toilet paper, baby products ...), it took a long time: it took a month and a half Alex Ipert, manager of the Carrefour contact de Breil-sur-Roya in Breil-sur -Roya, the bakery is also back in service.

One is a virologist, she studies viruses. The other is an epidemiologist and as such, he examines the indicators of the level of circulation and transmission of diseases.

But these holidays are also the occasion for a strong mixing of populations on a European scale, even worldwide. And this is what worries the scientific community. As Myl\xe8ne Ogliastro explains in the interview she gave us, it is only mid-January that we will be fixed, because there is always a delay effect of 15 days, 3 weeks: Mircea Sofonea emphasizes that we are on a ""ridge line"", with a reproduction rate (number of people infected by a carrier of the coronavirus) slightly above 1, between 1.05 and 1.15, a sign that the epidemic is progressing slowly : Its analysis is based on indicators of hospital dynamics and confirms that if we are not careful, ""the epidemic may start again in the coming days, by January 15, in terms of the influx of Covid patients in hospital services, to go back to 3000 nationally. ""As a researcher, Mircea Sofonea is careful not to prescribe such or such health policy. But he observes that it is this figure of 3,000 patients hospitalized in intensive care, intensive care or continuing that was one of the criteria used to reconfigure us at the end of October. According to him, ""we can therefore expect that the measures be reinforced today to avoid exceeding this threshold again "". Especially since the drop in temperatures and humidity in winter do not favor the decrease in the circulation of the virus.For Myl\xe8ne Ogliastro, the start of vaccination, which she strongly encourages, should not lead to a reduction health measures, nor barrier gestures. Because the effects of the vaccine will only be measurable in a few weeks or months: More than ever, we must continue! We are rediscovering what an epidemic is, what our ancestors experienced with the Spanish flu of 1918-1919. Since then, with the advances in science, technology and medicine, our societies have been kept away from contagious diseases. But they are coming back and we will have to relearn how to live in uncertainty.

It is initially at this level that, according to him ""measures should first be taken to stem the epidemic resumption where it takes place"". Because to this day, some areas remain relatively untouched, such as Brittany, Corsica or parts of New Aquitaine. At the end of December 2020, Occitania remains in an intermediate position. Mircea Sofonea notes an upsurge in the influx of intensive care admissions in several departments, in particular the Gard, which testifies to a resumption of the epidemic that is more important than in other more preserved regions. In this context, the question of the reopening of bars and restaurants on January 20, 2021 arises in Occitania. The public authorities should provide a response in the coming days. '",False

While the tourism sector is particularly battered with the Covid epidemic, launching a new line remains a challenge. ""Usually, we start from Nantes, and since we are from the metropolis of Rennes, it is more practical"" explains Ga\xeblle, a regular tourist from Morocco, on the tarmac upon exiting the plane for this first flight. ""For the children, we come back to see the French family to celebrate Christmas. The airport is smaller than that of Nantes and easier. access "", explains Olivier, accompanied by Bouchra and their children. These families have spent around 250 euros round trip per passenger to come from Casablanca. Launching a new airline in the midst of health turmoil is a daring gamble. However, the low-cost airline Air Arabia will operate since October 18 two rotations per week to connect Casablanca. For two years, the Moroccan consulate in Rennes and the Breton airport have been working on this project. As stated by Najoua El Berrak, the Consul General of Morocco for the Great West, there is ""a large Moroccan and bi-national community in Brittany and Lower Normandy which has been waiting for this line for years."" ""The proof is that this Friday\'s flight has 156 passengers while it is a first flight,"" she adds. The launch of this new line however comes in a difficult context for air transport and companies. With the coronavirus pandemic, countries closed their borders for several months and drastically limited air links. Likewise, domestic flights have experienced a significant decline as a result of travel restrictions. In Rennes, the number of passengers transported in 2020 fell by more than 60% compared to last year. And the airport, operated jointly by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Vinci group, cannot count on subsidies to attract companies. ""The Region does not finance any line, does not subsidize low-cost , as soon as the relevance and the economic and therefore public utility is proven, it must work. "" explains G\xe9rard Lahellec, vice-president in charge of transport to the Regional Councilor. Three new routes are being offered from these end-of-year holidays, but there is nothing to indicate that these new lines will be maintained beyond the end of the year holidays, especially in the current economic and health context.

The twelve chalets are ""each spaced four meters apart with a barrier in front and a very strict protocol,"" recalls Fran\xe7oise Gaudefroy, treasurer of the federation of traders in Amiens. We had drawn up a health protocol signed by all the chalets and fairground attractions. I don\'t see where the concern is, especially since it was validated by the prefect. remove them three days later, I find that unfair.

The manager deplores above all the ""various procrastination of the public authorities,"" which successively suggested the opening of chalets at the end of November, on December 5 then on December 17, before closing them. In their chalets, most traders had incurred expenses for these few days in the city center. ""We heard the news last night. We are both sad and outraged because we came from Quebec on purpose. We did 6,000 kilometers, that\'s not nothing,"" sighs Juliette Viseur, who runs the Quebec stand, present at the Christmas market in Amiens for 14 years.Michel Pham had filled his freezer with spring rolls for two days of market.

Because of the epidemic, he has not paid for himself since the last Christmas market in December 2019. Normally, the state is made to protect us. We pay taxes to be protected and so that we can continue to live. Two years ago, the chalets were closed to us because of the yellow vests. This year, the prefecture asks us again to close and says it is to protect us. No, it must be the other way around! They must be there to protect us so that we can open! Jean-Fran\xe7ois Gorisse, waffle seller ""I do not understand why the authorities tell us that these ten chalets are serious for people, continues the trader. You can walk in the city, we do all our shopping, we go everywhere. But our ten chalets seemingly represent a risk. There is a moment, me, I take it really badly: I am a citizen, I pay my taxes, I pay the RSI, I have been working in my company for 25 years, ""he underlines. Fran\xe7ois Gaudefroy points to the contrast with the shopping centers and supermarkets on the outskirts, whose footfall remains high. I think there is still less risk in the city center and in the open air, she says. We feel like we have several countries in one country, that really shocks me. (...) We notice that people want to see us and we are told: ""sir, you are not one of the desirable people"". I no longer feel safe in this country. If France were in Africa, plagued by epidemics of Ebola, Zika, malaria, cholera, what would we have done? We would all be locked in jails?

For the L214 association, only ""the magic of Christmas"" could allow corrections in 48 hours. Is the ""magic of Christmas"" already at work in the Cher? For the animal protection association L214, this is the only possible explanation after the lifting of the formal notice of the Blancafort slaughterhouse by the prefecture of Cher this Friday, December 18. The company was thus notified this Wednesday, December 16 of a suspension of approval, with 48 hours of delay to resolve a series of ""major non-conformities"" with the regulations in the field of animal protection, as noted by the prefecture. And indeed, two days later, the state services announced by press release that ""the 48 hours have been used to resolve non-conformities and comply with regulations in the field of animal protection"" . A decision ""totally puzzling"", we believe on the side of L214, which posted a video on Wednesday on the conditions of slaughter of turkeys within the Blancafort site. ""It is astonishing that in the space of 48 hours, the slaughterhouse, which continued to slaughter more than 10,000 turkeys per day, was able to resolve the major non-conformities which require the conduct of substantial work to be resolved. So what is its secret? ""Asks the association. Because these non-conformities are structural: ""It would be necessary to lower the floor or raise the chain so that the heads of the turkeys suspended upside down do not drag on the ground. And the chain which rises several meters which must be accessible: is they bought stilts? Another question: how the duration of suspension of the turkeys was shortened without accelerating the speed of the chain, in a slaughterhouse where the employees are already exhausted? . The prefecture does not specify indeed not the corrective measures applied by the slaughterhouse, and even less their application deadlines. Because the text implies half-heartedly that these corrections have not yet been applied, but that the company ""undertakes to remove the non-conformities"", without an announced deadline. If you too think that this slaughterhouse must stop working immediately, sign our petition: https: //t.co/TZA8IRh7un ""This is what we feared: immediate minor corrective measures and an action plan, we do not know over how many years"" , regrets L214. The association thus estimates that the State services are ""a thousand times complicit"" in the suffering of these turkeys, because ""they allow a slaughterhouse to operate which does not comply with the regulations"". L214 is now asking the State to prove his good faith, by publishing the various inspection reports of the prefecture. She also wants to be able to visit the slaughterhouse in the presence of a parliamentarian, to check the compliance of the Blancafort site. ""Parliamentarians can question the government after having witnessed these things"", explains the association. Contacted, the services of the prefecture of Cher are unavailable during the weekend.

In this article, he explains his decision. He took over the presidency this summer just after his appointment as mayor of Tours in June 2020. Emmanuel Denis decided this Thursday, December 17 to leave the post of president of the mixed union of the airport de Tours (SMADAIT), which he held as Vice-President of Tours M\xe9tropole. An announcement that had the effect of a bomb during a restless metropolitan council.Emmanuel Denis: It is a very complex issue. The airport\'s business model is bad, especially with the health and economic crisis we are experiencing today. The aeronautics sector is completely sluggish [more than 2 flights per week from Tours to Porto]. In addition, the certification and renovation work on the airport platform made civilian by the army will be extremely expensive [9 million euros at least] and we owe it to ourselves to make concessions. The ambition displayed for almost 2 years has been to end collaboration with Ryanair from 2022 and to favor the lines of economic interest for the city. By reducing the subsidies addressed to this company for certain airlines [Emmanuel Denis considers the Tours - Marrakech and Tours - Marseille lines too expensive for communities], the objective was to save nearly 2 million euros. An amount that would have enabled us to obtain a contract extension from the public service delegation, at no additional cost for local communities. At the same time, the idea was also to favor incoming flights so as not to compete with the TGV. on the interior lines. But also to make the grounds of Tours airport a virtuous site, with the installation of an agro-photovoltaic park with the production of green hydrogen. Emmanuel Denis: That is completely false. I have always been involved, honest and transparent in this project. I had revealed everything to my coworkers on Monday, December 14 and they had known my intentions from the start. Emmanuel Denis: I have put a lot of energy into this file but I do not have time for these slanders. If I have world champions in front of me, let them deal with it. My time is already tight and I have other projects of general interest for the city of Tours. People who quibble are unaware of the economic and ecological crisis we are going through. I am completely satisfied with my decision. After the resignation of Emmanuel Denis as president of the mixed union at Tours airport on Thursday December 17, a press point was organized on Monday December 21 to clarify the situation. Regarding first of all the lines towards Marrakech and Marseille, the region, the department and the metropolis want for the moment to maintain them. ""The lines which were those of 2019 are maintained for 2021. [] Then obviously, it is necessary be careful that the maintenance of these lines does not explode the budget of our local authorities.

In any case, we have experienced a strong and united movement, joined by the staff of Altkirch for example, and then we must recognize that we were heard by our management "". In a press release, said management also specifies the terms of this way out of the crisis. Between August and November 2019, nurses, nursing assistants, stretcher bearers, reception agents and medical regulatory officers (ARM) were recruited to strengthen the teams of the emergency reception services (SAU) of Mulhouse and Saint- Louis. These hires represent 23.9 full-time equivalents at a cost of 1.1 million euros. A massive campaign to integrate into the public service took place in the summer of 2019 for nurses and nursing assistants. Competitions also made it possible to integrate 4 ARMs in 2019 and 3 ARMs in 2020. The staff also had material demands that were heard. ""The logistics, hotel and biomedical equipment were renewed in 2019 and 2020 for a total amount of  350,000.

Extended time slots, 0 CO\xb2 emission buses, new routes, here is what should change. The metropolis of Clermont-Ferrand unveiled a new project to restructure the public transport network on Friday, December 18. It is subject to public consultation and can therefore be modified, but some major axes have already been defined by the metropolis and the SMTC (Syndicat Mixte des Transports en Commun de l\'Agglom\xe9ration Clermontoise), for a budget of 280 million euros. . The restructuring will mainly concern lines B and C, which will become high level service bus lines (BRT) ""with new zero emission buses on lanes reserved for them. The high level of service will also bring improved journey times, more regularity, more punctuality, more comfort and safety, and extended time slots. A tender has been launched to procure rolling stock, which could for example run on hydrogen or electricity. These buses will run from 5 hours to 1 hour, will serve new stops and run at 20 km / h on average, in order to guarantee a journey time equivalent to that of the car. Work should begin in 2024, for commissioning in 2026. Here is the plan for this future network: The proposal to improve these lines is accompanied by ""20% additional supply, or one million km in more each year on lines B and C and a million km more on the rest of the urban bus network , according to the metropolis of Clermont-Ferrand. From 2026, the new public transport network will connect at several points to the three lines A, B and C, with new connection possibilities to irrigate the territories of the metropolis. The goal is to put each city in the metropolis 30 minutes from the city center and each inhabitant 30 minutes from essential services. In total, the public supply of public transport will increase by 20% for an expected increase of 50%. Seven municipalities are affected by this restructuring plan: Aulnat, Aubi\xe8re, Chamali\xe8res, Clermont-Ferrand, Cournon-d\'Auvergne, Durtol and Royat. The restructuring plan also promises a bus every 6 minutes during rush hour. Cycle paths should run alongside the new bus lanes, in parallel with the already ratified trail maps. To replace the car, this project focused on the trips made by residents. It is a question of facilitating: On the decision not to touch the tramway, Olivier Bianchi, mayor of Clermont-Ferrand and president of the metropolis, explains: We have a particular case which is this line A which must be redesigned and we we need money to imagine its transformation in 2030, certainly in rail mode. At the same time, there is a line B project that was conceived at the same time as line A, and it was around 240 million euros for 7 or 8 kilometers. One cannot imagine 8 kilometers at 240 million euros in the territory of Clermont alone. It became nonsense, it did not respond to the problems of commuters, it did not connect large structures like airports or the Zenith, and then it was politically unacceptable to the 20 other mayors of the metropolis. We realized while visiting BRT lines in Nantes, where they are not far from 50 kilometers, that it is exactly the same service as the tram and that the vehicles have the appearance of a tram. ""There are no plans to increase the price of the ticket or subscription related to the project. According to Fran\xe7ois Rage, 1st Vice-President of Clermont Auvergne M\xe9tropole in charge of sustainable mobility and president of the SMTC-AC, discussions are underway on a free experiment.

Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne announced new measures to help traders, hoteliers and seasonal workers in Lourdes, a deserted city. For months, the Marian city has only been a shadow of itself. The curtains of hotels and pious shops are still drawn. The shrine is running slowly. But prayers are no longer enough to restore hope to hoteliers, traders and seasonal workers in the valley. This Friday, December 18, the Secretary of State for Tourism made a new appearance in Lourdes. The third in less than a year.

The same goes for airport and shopping arcade shops, translators-interpreters, crafts and water transport services. The city has already benefited from 52 million euros in specific aid within the framework of the tourism stimulus plan. This Friday, the Secretary of State for Tourism extended this budget by an additional 20 million. A sum that includes (this time) an aid for seasonal workers, forgotten during the first measures. Seasonal workers who will be entitled to ""tailor-made support"" specified the Secretary of State for Tourism with a safety net of 900 euros monthly until February 2021 for those who receive the RSA (Income of active solidarity) Emilie Auburgan, the president of the seasonal association of Lourdes and its valley reacts: It is very positive to have been able to participate in this round table.

And of course that of tourism. INSEE has looked into its impact on overnight hotel stays. In Occitania, they were divided by 2 compared to last year between April and September.Even if the months of July and August gave it some color, the hotel sector, as we can imagine, suffered greatly from the health crisis. The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee) has looked into its impact on hotel attendance in Occitania and the finding is clear: for the summer season, from April to September, overnight stays hotels have been divided by 2 compared to last year in the region. Some sectors are doing better than others despite everything, but the Toulouse metropolis and the city of Lourdes, France's second largest hotel city, are severely affected by the disaffection of tourists. According to INSEE, the confinement put in place in mid-March and then the ban on driving beyond 100 km from his home put a real halt to hotel activity. In April, only 23% of hotels in Occitanie were open and 38% in May. During these two months, hotel nights fell by 94% in the region compared to the same two months of 2019, as this graph shows: As this graph also shows, after a tentative recovery in June, the arrival summer vacations and the end of travel restrictions allowed a revival in July and August. Occitania benefited from the French clientele and limited the losses linked to the absence of foreign tourists, even if the hotel activity remained below the figures of 2019. If we note a clear recovery in July August, we also note strong disparities according to the territories. The tourists favored the countryside, the mountains and the coast this summer. A combined effect of the heat wave and the fear of the virus have led tourists to favor regions with less population density and warmer temperatures. In our region, Loz\xe8re, Lot, Aveyron and Tarn-et-Garonne thus saw their hotel activity grow.These differences are also found in the catering sector where turnover only increased in two departments. : Ari\xe8ge (+ 16%) and Loz\xe8re (+ 7%). Tourists have rather shunned urban areas. This is particularly true in Toulouse where overnight stays in hotels fell by 40% in July and August compared to 2019. This drop is limited to 4% in Montpellier, undoubtedly because of its proximity to the sea and is average of 14% in the urban areas of the region. Compared to this average, Lourdes takes the plunge. It recorded an 84% drop in July and August compared to 2019.The Marian City is the second hotel city in France, behind Paris, and it is normally during these two months that it experiences its maximum tourist influx. The cancellation of many pilgrimages resulted in the closure of many hotels. Not to mention the absence of foreign tourists who normally represent two-thirds of its attendance.If the recovery in July and August had been able to restore color to the regional hotel sector, this revival was quickly denied in September. The resumption of the Covid-19 epidemic and the strengthening of health restrictions have cut the momentum of French travelers. And the confinements put in place in several countries have not been conducive to the return of foreign customers. The sector is therefore down 35% compared to September 2019, and metropolitan areas will not have been able to rely on business tourism either. Between remote work and the cancellation of many events, it has for example fallen by 49% in the Toulouse metropolis. """,False

To become the owner of their house, a dream for many French people, but which is often stopped because of the cost of construction. What if the solution to save money was to recycle old shipping containers to build inexpensively and do something for the planet?

At the time, an earthquake had just ravaged Haiti: ""I was in front of a container and I said to myself, but that\'s what it takes, because it\'s a metal box, more solid since it transports tons and tons on all seas. The container, for me, and for many I think, is a waste of globalization. And it\'s time to recycle today and stop producing. "" Strength and sturdiness are not the only advantages of container constructions. According to Renaud Leclerc, architect, the thin metal structure allows buildings to be better insulated: ""We have specificities from a thermal and acoustic point of view which are not in common with traditional construction, we also have an insulation facilitated by the structural core which is much thinner than what is found in traditional cinderblock or concrete frames "". But the main purchase criterion remains the price, and that Alain Krizanowski understood it well. So, he had an idea: the low-cost container house:  77,000 for 81 square meters. ""The low-cost house was a demand because first-time buyers and families need affordable housing. and we realized that in the more than 3000 requests that we had that there were people who wanted to build themselves without having construction problems, ""explains the business manager. the majority of requests concern public buildings.

A first result of the work of researchers from Dijon.The government put a rental map online at the beginning of December 2020 for all the municipalities in France. Data already existed for large agglomerations but this is the first time that work has been carried out on the whole of France. Three researchers from Inrae and AgroSup Dijon worked on this project within the Center for Economics and Sociology Applied to Agriculture and Rural Areas (Cesaer). The economists Julie Le Gallo and Marie Breuill\xe9 and the geographer Camille Grivault have therefore analyzed millions of real estate ads published on the Leboncoin, Seloger.com and PAP sites in the third quarter of 2018. Their work covers both apartments and houses . ""This is completely new. This is the first time that there is this type of official partnership that has been set up between the State and the platforms to be able to access their exhaustive databases"", explains the economist Julie Le Gallo Unsurprisingly, the highest rents are concentrated in large urban centers and tourist areas. We had a certain number of intuitions, so we didn\'t have very big surprises when we saw the map. But it allows us to be objective where we had no indicators. We have rents. which vary a lot according to the municipalities. There can be differences of 6 to 7 times between the rural municipalities and the rents that one finds in Paris, details the researcher. Even at a local level, there are very strong variations. "" Regarding Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\xe9 more particularly, we find particularly high rents on the Dijon-Beaune-Chalon-sur-Sa\xf4ne axis on the one hand. And on the Dijon-Dole-Besan\xe7on axis on the other hand. Julie Le Gallo, economist If the map is not displayed, click here ""What also stands out quite clearly is the Swiss border area,"" There are also small towns which structure rural areas. Small and medium-sized employment centers can play a very structuring role locally in the territories. In Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\xe9, Avallon, Saulieu or Semur-en-Auxois stand out. "" Thus, in Burgundy, it is the Dijon agglomeration which concentrates the highest rents for houses (charges included).  10.90 on average in Fontaine-l\xe8s-Dijon,  10.30 in Dijon. In Franche-Comt\xe9, rents are highest in the communes of Rousses, Morbier and even Pr\xe9manon:  13.10 per m\xb2. On the other hand, in Ni\xe8vre or Haute-Sa\xf4ne, the average rent is just over  5 per m\xb2 in some municipalities. To compare the territories with each other, the researchers calculated rents including charges for standard accommodation of 49 m\xb2 for apartments and 92 m\xb2 for houses. In the municipalities for which they did not have data, it was necessary to extrapolate from similar towns. The rental card is intended for the general public as well as for professionals or public authorities. ""The idea for the moment was to make information available to the public on areas where we had none or very little,"" says the economist. The public at large, both individuals who may want to have an idea of the rent of the municipality that they are targeting but also the owners, investors, professionals. We are really in an objective of knowing the rental market. """" There will be an objective for public policies which is to be able to modulate housing policies to the realities of the territories.

The new municipal majority in Noyon, in the Oise, broke the project of the Maison de la Presse, which thought it could sell tobacco for complete her activity, sparking both political and legal controversy. A tobacco story ignites the first months of the mandate of the new mayor of Noyon (Oise), Sandrine Dauchelle (LR), with the opposition blowing on the embers. The downtown press house, looking for a buyer, said it was condemned by the municipality, which refused it a weighty argument: the right to sell tobacco, a more profitable activity, in addition to books.\r\nFollowing the bankruptcy of a neighboring bar-tabac, the Balto, the former municipality had bought back the license IV of liquor outlet by promising the Maison de la Presse - via a ""certificate"" submitted between the two rounds of the municipal election - to sell it to him, by linking the activity of tobacco sales. ""There are 1,500 who have done it in France and it is thanks to that that they hold,"" says Philippe Bidault, co-owner of the business. Disillusionment during the last municipal council: the license will be sold to the buyers of the bar, not at the Press House, for legal reasons. I don\'t make promises I can\'t keep. Legally, we were formally told that this was not possible. So I decided. I am not a fanciful mayor. Sandrine Dauchelle, mayor of Noyon The regulation of tobacco shops is straightforward, but a few fundamental principles can be laid down: it is the State which gives the authorizations for creation; all businesses are eligible, except dry cleaners and butcher shops; the town halls are however competent to transfer an existing said from one business to another, within its municipality. So, to sell tobacco, the Press House had to fight for the license IV of Balto ? According to our exchanges with the customs of Picardy, no. The sale of the license does not entail the tobacco store business. The new owners of the license will not have an automatic right to sell tobacco: they will have to submit a new request to customs. On paper, it would have been possible to sell the liquor license to the buyers of the bar, while transferring the tobacco business to the press house. Philippe Bidault contests: ""I had five exchanges with a manager customs who assured me that the license and the tobacco store were inseparable, and that we could then return the drink section, which obviously does not interest us. Frankly, I would not fight like that if there had even the smallest grain of sand. ""Justice may have to decide. ""We are going to the administrative court, announces Philippe Bidault. There are two irregularities. We are not going to give up."" Closely studying the projects of both parties, but Sandrine Dauchelle is at a loss to explain what investors intend to do of the building they are buying: ""I can inquire if you wish.""\r\nBeyond the legal debate, Philippe Bidault does not hide his bitterness. For him, the new city councilor wants above all to wipe out the past and favor those close to him. One has the impression that she is resentful of her predecessor. We don\'t play politics. If she had told us from the start that she had people to serve first, we would have closed and voila! But it amused us, to finally hand over the license to investors, who make an investment, and who lived for decades next to her.Philippe Bidault, co-owner of the Maison de la presse\r\n""I do not know them at all, it is part of the rumors of my opponents, categorically denies Madam Mayor. I do things without a partisan spirit.

Seven years after Fiona\'s disappearance, this case continues to fascinate the public. Wednesday, December 16. It is around 4 p.m. when, after more than 5 hours of deliberation, the Rh\xf4ne Assize Court in Lyon delivers its verdict. She sentences Fiona\'s mother, C\xe9cile Bourgeon to 20 years of criminal imprisonment and Berkane Makhlouf, her ex-companion to 18 years in prison. Seven years after the girls disappearance, the Fiona case, as the media call it, continues to fascinate the public. Every morning during the three weeks of the trial, the onlookers were there, loyal to the post. Caroline Girardon, journalist for the daily 20 minutes, attended the trial in Lyon. She explains: There has been a progression. There were not many people the first few days. I\'ll put that down to containment. When it was lifted on December 15, there was even more audience. The rows have grown over the days. Tuesday and Wednesday there were a lot of people. We were reaching the end of the trial, requisitions and pleadings were awaited, and especially the verdict. It coincided with the end of confinement. The worst was during the first trial in Riom Val\xe9rie Riffard, a journalist with France 3 Auvergne, covered the four trials of the accused couple. She says: The worst was during the first trial in Riom: people arrived at 6 am to make sure they had a seat. In Puy-en-Velay it was a little less true. In Lyon, the public came gradually. This last week people came early. There were also many law students . This trial received less coverage in the national press than it had in the past. The usual chroniclers were in Paris for the Sarkozy trial. But the articles devoted to the narrative of the debates interested the public. Caroline Girardon emphasizes: The first papers worked moderately. But as soon as I started making papers with angles, they became cardboard. Readers have flocked to it, if we can put it that way. For example, the article on ""The Couple\'s Disturbing Internet Searches"" sold the most, with 311,000 views. The first paper had 24,000 views, but then the second had 115,000 views. The journalist does not qualify this fascination as unhealthy. She specifies: I don\'t know if we can qualify this fascination as unhealthy because behind this word, there is a value judgment. In general, there is a fascination of readers, listeners, spectators for the news. It is not from today. It refers to patterns of society. But on the Fiona case, I think it fascinates as much because it concerns a child. When a news item concerns a child and the death of a child, people may feel more concerned and are more affected. There is a stronger emotional side. Fiona is a 5 year old girl who has never been found. We don\'t know what happened. His body has not been found. There is outrage on the part of the public that this child will never be found and will not be buried. Nobody knows the truth and people want to discover it. She adds: My second hypothesis, which is related to the Daval affair, is that this story fascinates because C\xe9cile Bourgeon lied for weeks or even months, to the whole of society, to public opinion. People sympathized at first. They had the image of a mother whose child had just been kidnapped. People who have children have identified with her. Later, they didn\'t accept to be betrayed. There is this anger side that we see very well on social networks, on the comments of the papers "". The parallel with the Daval case, this woman murdered by her husband Jonathann, Caroline Girardon is not the only one to do so. Val\xe9rie Riffard, journalist at France 3 Auvergne, also allows herself: What really makes all the difference, a bit like with the Daval affair, is the lie. There are also unanswered questions as in the Dupont de Ligonn\xe8s case. Fiona we don\'t know where her body is. For the first trial in Riom, people were there to shout their hatred. They blame C\xe9cile Bourgeon more for having lied than for having killed her daughter. ""For the 20-minute journalist, this affair takes on an extraordinary character:"" This trial had a particular flavor. This case received a lot of publicity. There is always a mystery. After this trial it is still unclear how Fiona died. It is also not known on what day she died. We don\'t know where she is today. People had followed the case really well, they know the '",False

Sytral (Syndicat Mixte des transports pour le Rh\xf4ne et agglom\xe9ration Lyonnaise) has been managed since the start of the school year by the new president of the metropolis of Lyon Bruno Bernard. The ecologist wishes to develop an ""ambitious project in the service of the cohesion of the territories and the energy transition"" for the period 2021-2026.\n\r\nGreater Lyon will experience a big bang in its transport offer. Thus, four new tram lines, extension of trainsets, high-level bus service, renewed diesel fleet in favor of electricity and city natural gas will be implemented. Finally, a cable car connecting the Gerland district to the west of Lyon will be the main novelty. The delivery of this airline is scheduled for the end of 2025, with the ambition to transport between 20,000 and 25,000 passengers per day.\n\r\nThe promise of the former mayor of Lyon, G\xe9rard Collomb, of an E metro to serve the west of Lyon has not been officially ruled out.

Faced with its unprecedented investments, the organizing authority still has a ""review clause"" in 2023, which will take particular account of the development of the economic crisis.\r\nBruno Bernard says he is acting for ""sustainable mobility"" in the face of the climate emergency.

Bruno Bernard: Yes, we have doubled Sytral\'s investment budget to bring it to 2.5 billion euros, it is twice as much as under the previous term. It is an ambitious policy to give alternatives to the car, to reduce pollution, to allow people to move more easily, to also make purchasing power gains because public transport costs much less than the car. . So it is a solution for the future for everyone. And so we are ambitious.France 3: What about the metro? Bruno Bernard: We are looking between several solutions.

Lecturer at the University of Grenoble, Nico Didry underlines the heavy economic impact caused by the closure of the ski lifts at Christmas. Shocks which extend beyond the Alps and risk to initiate a vast questioning for the ski resorts. At the dawn of the end of year celebrations, the closure of the ski lifts until the beginning of much has been said about 2021. The mountain world has expressed its incomprehension about this decision taken to limit the spread of Covid-19. Nico Didry, lecturer at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Grenoble-Alpes, underlines the major economic impact of this measure, well beyond our massifs. The former coach of the French snowboard team points to the ""lack of pedagogy"" of political decision-makers who ""reinforce false and negative prejudices on the mountain"", adding to the incomprehension. Local businesses, investors ... What is The economic impact of the closure of the ski lifts for the Christmas holidays? One cannot imagine all the economic ramifications that this implies. Even locals, who are at the heart of the mountain world, have a reductive vision of this universe. And politicians\' speeches perpetuate prejudices according to which the mountain is a microcosm, the resorts are small amusement parks, and if we do not live in the mountains, we will not be impacted. But no. We have to imagine that the economic impact extends far beyond our territory, and beyond the temporality of winter. What exactly does this imply? For example, apartment owners , who do not necessarily live in the resort, will see their income decrease. There are other direct repercussions, on the reduction in the number of mountain TGVs for example. Who is impacted? These are SNCF employees, some of whom risk being placed on partial unemployment. If we stay on transport, there are also all taxis that go from Grenoble airport to stations. All these carriers will also be impacted, even if they do not live directly in the territory. In terms of investments, it will not only affect companies located in the territory, it can be the media [with the drop in revenues advertising, editor\'s note], consulting agencies outside the territory. The entire economic ecosystem of the Grenoble, Chamb\xe9ry and Annecy valley, and even Lyon, is affected. The world of industry and events will also suffer, and not only this winter.You deplore a form of disconnection of the political milieu vis-\xe0-vis the mountain world ... There is really a job. of pedagogy to do. There is both clumsiness, or ignorance or incompetence. Jean Castex said that the stations were going to remain open, but a station is a territory, there are people who live there. It is not possible to reason like that because it reinforces the idea that the station is an amusement park. It is also the return of boomerangs for the stations which had communicated a lot about skiing. When the politicians make a decision, we have to put forward the right indicators and that was not the case. They reinforce the false and negative prejudices that one can have on the mountain. Eric Piolle declared on BFMTV that skiing only concerns ""a very small part of the French population"", that ""it is not a major subject "". What do you think? He analyzes the ski world and the ski economy by talking about the number of customers. But it is not the number of practitioners that must be seen, it is the number of people affected by this closure. The economic weight is sprawling with ramifications everywhere in the short and medium term. Eric Piolle, when he says that, makes a fundamental mistake. Because this closure will impact a lot of people who are in social and economic suffering on the ground. We have the image of Courchevel or M\xe9ribel, but that\'s not just that. So local elected officials can also show a lack of education? The decrees taken by mayors to prohibit access to ski areas are suffering from \'a real lack of communication. When the mayor of a municipality takes an order, it is not to annoy people, it is to take out the umbrella and not to be held responsible in the event of an accident. Even if the ski area is closed, he is still responsible. What we observed, especially in Sept-Laux, is that the resort did not communicate on the decree. It was not posted on his site, nor on social networks. It is not displayed anywhere. And when you read the decree, you can think that they want to ban everything. This is not the case, but there is no explanation provided. This is purely administrative information '",False

The security forces suspected some delivery men of ""outsourcing"" their licenses to precarious people in an irregular situation. ""With the closure of restaurants, take-out is very successful in Annecy, analyzes Commander Isabelle Labb\xe9. It is a juicy market and where there is money to be made, there is embezzlement nearby."" For some home meal delivery people, this outsourcing technique can indeed be very lucrative. To sublet his license, the delivery person shares his professional profile (Deliveroo or Uber Eats for example) to a third party. Often this is a person without a residence permit who cannot officially work. On behalf of the delivery person, this subcontractor makes about ten deliveries per day. In exchange, the license holder gives him about fifteen euros, but he is the one who pockets all the commissions of the delivery platform. ""It\'s very beneficial for the delivery man,"" laments Isabelle Labb\xe9. To carry out checks and identify this type of abuse, a dozen police officers are placed at strategic locations in the city of Annecy, ""such as the Banque de France roundabout which gives direct access to the city center, explains Isabelle Labb\xe9.

A new demonstration this Thursday evening. The union, which refused to participate in the Beauvau de la s\xe9curit\xe9, wants to keep up the pressure. Philippe Dosba, Alliance\'s regional vice-president, tells us why. Pressure is mounting between the police and the government. Friday 11 took place Act I. Between 200 and 300 police officers gathered in front of the Gironde prefecture in Bordeaux at the end of the morning at the call of the Alliance union. They intended to denounce the remarks made by President Emmanuel Macron during an interview with Brut on December 4. Comments qualified as ""nauseating"" by Philippe Dosba who continues to reject the allusion to ""facies checks and illegitimate violence committed by police officers"". This evening, at 9:30 p.m., the police will gather in front of Bordeaux town hall. They will brave the curfew to ""associate the night colleagues"", themselves also confronted with attacks, recalls Philippe Dosba: Three weeks ago, at 6 am, there was an intervention for drunk people in the street who were returning from an evening despite confinement. A colleague had 45 days of temporary incapacity for work. The authors were condemned but released. Act II of this evening is a nod to the movement of yellow vests, even if, concedes the regional vice-president of Alliance ""We will never go to the \'act 50 or 70 "". For months the police have been denigrated, insulted, injured and contested on all interventions. The pressure cooker begins to heat up. When police officers are involved in a case and injured, the perpetrators are sentenced to penalties that are not commensurate with the penalties incurred. Alliance and Unsa, two of the main police unions, raised the tone on Tuesday, announcing that they would not participate in the conference called ""Beauvau de la s\xe9curit\xe9"" scheduled for January, and aimed at \'""improving the conditions of exercise ""Of the police and"" consolidate ""their links with the French. ""We do not want the themes that we have been carrying for months and for which we have no guarantee not be dealt with"" is justified Philippe Dosba: We must not forget what we have been asking for ages: a revaluation of salaries and careers, the protection of the police which remained a dead letter after being debated in the assembly and in the street with the famous article 24. The regional vice-president of Alliance assures him, the fed up Anger is pervasive among police officers who have the feeling of a double standard. We need to put the church back in the middle of the village. The police are there to uphold the Republican order. We cannot mistreat them, insult them. We can sense a protest that is not just about the police. We know that the action of the police is relayed by the media or on the Internet through truncated images. Those tours during the violent arrest of Michel Zecler, Parisian music producer were shocking. If Philippe Dosba refuses to comment on an ongoing case, he admits that there may be violent behavior among the police but in a minority. Of the three million interventions per year, some are confusing but are a tiny fraction. party and we only retain those. We are like everyone else, we also have deviant behavior. We do not dispute the need to punish the police. There is the IGPN. There is also a platform to complain about police behavior. We are the profession the most controlled and the most sanctioned. Faced with the refusal of Alliance and Unsa to participate in the Beauvau of security, a connoisseur of the mysteries of the Ministry of the Interior spoke of ""a kind of blackmail unprecedented "", of"" a risk that this will block the machine of social dialogue "".

A discovery that meets an increasingly pressing need. The Elicit Plant research center is located in Vilhonneur in Charente near Angoul\xeame. The laboratory, positioned in the sector of ecological transition in agriculture, has just developed a natural process capable of combating the harmful effects of the lack of water on plants, in particular those of field crops such as soybeans or corn. The product developed by the Charente research center is based on phytosterols, natural plant lipids. They are intended to be applied as a spray to plants, especially soybeans, a variety commonly grown in the region. This product is 100% natural and even edible, assures Aymeric Molin, the general manager of Elicit Plant All our products are natural and listed in the Codex Alimentarius and are therefore edible. We have sought to make a product that is liquid, not too much and that does not foam. Furthermore, it is sought that the particles are of a sufficiently small size to be able to easily enter the plants and that there is no loss at the time of spraying. Aymeric Molin, Managing Director of Elicit Plant This patent developed in the laboratories of Elicit Plant is designed to allow plants to better resist all stresses and in the first place, water stress which leads to their wilting and ultimately their death . The product allows the introduction into plants of additional phytosterols, a natural material of plant origin that controls evaporation. To develop products intended for sale to farmers, Elicit Plant reproduces soybean growing conditions in its greenhouses. These tests are an intermediate stage between the purely theoretical tests in the laboratory and the setting in the field. We have an intermediate stage with these culture chamber trials which can allow us to adjust the dose, to see the effects of the product and also to select the best formulation to then offer to farmers.Geoffrey Delage, agricultural engineer These culture chambers have mission is to reproduce the natural environment as much as possible. The temperature is constantly around 25 degrees and the humidity is around 70%. Then, it's simple, just cut off the irrigation of the plants and wait to see if those that have been treated are more resistant than the others that have not received the product.We see that the resistance to water stress is very high. more important on the treated pot. It shows that the wilting point is reached much later for the treated plants. We cut off the water for all of them and a week later, we observe that one of the plants will be drier while the other will resist better and reach the same point of drought as a few days later.Geoffrey Delage, agricultural engineer research based in Vilhonneur initially focused on working on resistance to water stress, but it wishes to broaden the scope of its research and develop products, always completely natural, that can act on other biotic stresses and pave the way to research on resistance to diseases and in particular to mildew in vines. Currently, the process against water stress is in the process of being approved on soybeans and corn. The laboratory is also continuing its research on wheat. """,True

In Lavilledieu in Ard\xe8che, the family business SOFABO is sounding the alarm. Same concern on the side of the beverage producers dependent on this sector of activity.The SOFABO warehouse in Lavilledieu, in Ard\xe8che, is at a standstill. Usually about twenty people work there for handling, storage and deliveries. The family business, created around thirty years ago, supplies some 250 customers with a variety of drinks. 95% are hotels, cafes and restaurants. With their closure today, all employees had to be placed on partial unemployment. Co-director Eric Fleurit Bourganel himself delivers what remains of orders: a few pallets of water for retirement homes. ""It is really a product with low added value, it is in a way to do a bit of public service with nursing homes."" In the administration part, his brother Thierry takes care of the accounting alone. The figures let fear the worst. Apart from this summer, every month is falling: ""With us it is almost 90% of turnover during the months when our customers are closed. Unfortunately, we are not considered in the same way as the cafetiers, hoteliers, restaurateurs who are in administrative closure. We do not benefit from the same aids in terms of covering the loss of turnover. We are reaching the end of the system and we are beginning to be in severe difficulty "". The distributor, like his colleagues, asks to be able to benefit from the same aids as the hotel and restaurant sector. For him, the survival of his company is at stake; for beverage manufacturers, the situation depends on positioning. For Eaux de Vals and the Bourganel brewery in Vals les Bains, large-scale distribution represents 70 to 80% of sales. The impact on turnover is therefore less. It is especially small businesses, which operate in short circuits, which are seriously affected. This is the case of the Ceven\'ale brewery in Rosi\xe8res. Created 9 years ago by Annie and Patrick Copetti, it made the choice of reasonable volumes, and sales to restaurants and wine merchants in Ard\xe8che.During the first confinement, everything being stopped, the loss of turnover has was 82%. In November, -50%, and December promises to be even lower. What compensated a little in southern Ard\xe8che, it is the summer season. It was particularly good among traders in July and August; enough to ensure a small emergency cash. The two founders put their employee on short-time work and lowered their own salaries. ""You have to manage to have enough to last until the end of March, I don\'t believe in reopening restaurants in January, given that culture has already been pushed back"" says Annie. It is also noticing that its wine merchant retailers have declined in activity at this less festive end of the year. The Eyguebelle syrups and liqueurs company is based in Vallaurie, in the Dr\xf4me region. It distributes 35% of its bottles in bars and restaurants throughout France. It is impacted by the closure of these establishments, with an annual loss in turnover which should be of the order of 10%. But it keeps its head above water thanks to an increase in its sales in supermarkets and a beautiful summer season. What worries its founder Jo\xebl Chalvet much more seriously is the future: ""The news are not good for the first quarter of 2021, we hear that the closures of bars and restaurants could be extended until March or April. The risk is that many professionals remain on the sidelines, put the key under the door. Now what is at stake is the evolution of the sector in 2021 and 2022. "" '",False

Already this Thursday, activists from Rennes of these associations had carried out a poster campaign on the LREM office in Ille-et-Vilaine.\r\nIn a joint press release, the three Rennes associations explain why they consider it urgent: In a period where bankruptcies and cascading layoffs continue in physical commerce, around ten new Amazon warehouses are in the process of being authorized by the state. The activists have decided to take action because it is urgent: the Citizen\'s Convention for the climate bill should be presented in the coming days and voted on from March. This is the last opportunity to stop Amazon\'s expansion in France.

""I have not changed my mind"" since, confirmed Monday, for the first time since his election, the one who is also the new mayor of Rouen. The young Fabiusien had, however, pronounced in favor of this project when he presided over the former region of Haute-Normandie. ""I am one of those who had underestimated the state of our planet"", a explained to the council Mr. Mayer-Rossignol, evoking a ""state of ecological emergency"". The Normandy Region (centrist) for its part confirmed to AFP that it was maintaining its funding to the tune of 157 million. And President LREM of Seine-Maritime said he was ""personally"" in favor of maintaining departmental funding, in a press release. The main contributor, the State, for his part said that he would not impose not against the local will of this project launched more than 40 years ago. The prefect has just asked by mail to the three communities to ""request confirmation by deliberation before the end of February of their financial commitment."" Have the elected representatives of the PS majority like their new president, changed their minds on the subject? Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol does not seem in a hurry to put the question to the vote. ""This is not a regulatory obligation,"" said the Socialist to the press before promising: ""The debate will take place."" It is obviously already revived. ""Some elected officials want to question this project. With us, reaffirm your support"", hammered every day from December 7 to 12 a full page of advertising bought by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) of the Metropolis, in the Paris-Normandy regional daily. For the CCI, the bypass is ""an ecological project"" which will divert the ""thousands of trucks"" which ""have no other solution than to cross the city center of Rouen"". And the forums on the subject have multiplied in the local press since the Council of State validated the public utility of the project in November. The circumvention is expected of all and its benefits are no longer to be demonstrated on the economic level. ,  social,  ecological and  safe. THE BYPASS IS NOW!

Warning messages are multiplying in the Alps to avoid tragedies, more fear than harm. Six hikers were swept away on Monday 14 December by an avalanche in the Ubaye valley (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence). Snow buried three of them, but they were rescued by a high mountain gendarmerie helicopter. Ski touring enthusiasts had set out to climb to the top of the Pic de l\'Aiguillette, and these dangerous snowfalls could well recur at the start of the season. For the day of December 13 alone, about twenty avalanches were reported in Savoie, Haute-Savoie and Hautes-Alpes, France 3 learned. One of them was filmed this weekend by skiers at Courchevel, in Savoie. ""Temperature variations affect the snowpack. At the moment, the snowpack is like a layer of polystyrene grains on which successive layers of snow are piled up. The weight of these superimposed layers makes the snowpack. extremely friable "", explains St\xe9phane Henry, director of the slopes service in Les Orres. It is the state of the snowpack that establishes the risk of avalanches. A delicate operation carried out by the trackers ""snow-meteorological observers"".

There are no longer any twists and turns in the construction of a 1,200 bull-bull farm in Coussay-les-Bois , in Vienne. The latest was played before the Administrative Court of Appeal of Bordeaux, this Tuesday, December 15. The judgments will be delivered on December 29th. Since December 2014, the promoter of the farm with 1,200 young bulls and the opponents of its construction have been increasing appeals to institutions or the courts. This project, which provides for the installation of livestock buildings and an anaerobic digestion plant, is contested by a group of residents, grouped together within the ASPECT association, (association for the protection and protection of the environment of Coussay -les-Bois and its thermal region), and elected officials of Coussay-les-Bois. A first public utility survey, carried out in 2016, gave a favorable opinion for the construction. The building permit and operating authorization granted by the Vienne prefecture were revoked the following year by the Poitiers administrative court. The promoter then appealed against this judgment and the administrative court of appeal of Bordeaux had been seized. In December 2019, the Bordeaux court had issued a stay of proceedings pending further information from the project promoter, the SCEA ""Les Nauds"", managed by Pierre Liot. The administrative court of appeal of Bordeaux must decide on the two building permit applications and on the operating permit application. The various players in this case will have to wait until December 29 to know the judgments of the Bordeaux court. If the conclusions of the public rapporteur are heard, the authorizations could be validated and the judgment of the administrative court of Poitiers challenged. The rapporteur explains that the new details provided by the SCEA ""Les Nauds"" are satisfactory. The Aspect association, which has been fighting for six years against the installation of this farm factory, reiterates its will to do everything to oppose this project and regrets that in the end, the form wins over the content. The Court of Appeal could annul the judgment of Poitiers because of the formal respect for the production of administrative documents, without examination of their content ... Whatever the Bordeaux judgment, we will continue the action to block this project which no longer corresponds to the current aspirations of citizens. ASPECT Association, an association for the protection and protection of the environment of Coussay-les-Bois and its thermal region ASPECT believes in a press release that the rejection of this project mobilizes well beyond the inhabitants of the town. June 2020 showed the convergence of citizen mobilization, local elected officials, the Prefecture of Vienne and the Ministry of Ecological Transition, to refuse the authorization to operate the factory farm. ASPECT Association, association for the protection and protection of the environment of Coussay-les-Bois and its thermal region The Ministry of Ecological Transition, in a letter dated November 26, expressed serious doubts about the feasibility of the project. Opponents, grouped within the ASPECT association, (association for the safeguard and protection of the environment of Coussay-les-Bois and its thermal region) have multiplied the demonstrations to denounce the harmful consequences for the environment and for the local breeders that this project will involve. For them, it is not an agricultural project but an industrial operation because the methanization unit built next to the three livestock buildings will transport the gas to a factory located in Ch\xe2tellerault and belonging to the company of Pierre Liot. The association believes that this plant is currently operated ""with contempt for the environment with discharges prohibited in the Vienne and non-compliance with the authorization to operate"". Michel Favreau, the mayor of the town, also affirms that the purpose of this project is above all industrial. ""The installation of the three sheds with the young bulls underneath is made for photovoltaics, it is not made for breeding. They are not breeding sheds at all.""

A demonstration is organized in the streets of the town to denounce the social plan which provides for the elimination of half of the positions in the company. 125 jobs are threatened.A week ago, on December 8, employees of the Gifrer-Barbezat company began a strike to protest against the elimination of 125 jobs out of the 211 at the pharmaceutical site located in D\xe9cines, in east of Lyon. They denounce in particular the closure of the production branch of this century-old site. The PES file must be completed by December 22, but a meeting for signature between the union and management is scheduled for Thursday, December 17. A new action was organized, on the eve of this meeting, to denounce these layoffs. It is also about protesting against the departure conditions offered to dismissed employees. Like last week, the Cfdt called on staff to demonstrate in the streets of D\xe9cines, from 10 a.m. According to the majority union in the company, the management offered a bonus of 500 euros for the months of December and January, ""on condition that the employees stop the strike and return to work"". For the Cfdt, After more than a week of strike, the latest management proposals are still not up to the expectations of employees. Joined this morning by phone, the site management explained to subject of this premium of 500 euros: ""it is an emergency measure to open the doors"" and ensure the shipments of products, expected by pharmacies and hospitals.

""It is important that the situation is released from an economic point of view for the company, but also because we are in a time of health crisis and that we must participate in the effort"".

All the more unacceptable as this PES will be put in place on Christmas Eve. For the union, the argument for maintaining employment does not hold water. Exit production, there will ultimately remain on site services such as marketing, logistics or regulatory services, we explain. Regarding subcontracting in France: the union specifies that part of the production (the liniment) goes to Belgium. The rest - flammable products and physiological serums - will be entrusted to a French manufacturer who works for several laboratories. Will it be able to maintain this production in France over the long term? On the side of the Cfdt, we are already wondering.

They wonder how they are going to be able to reclassify themselves in the current economic context. The company which has had different addresses in Rennes has been in existence for 63 years. Previously identified under the name Cartonnerie de Maurepas, it has experienced various takeovers. Today it is one of the 350 sites of the Smurfit Kappa group, which has 46,000 employees worldwide and is headquartered in Ireland.

Like her colleagues, she was surprised by this sudden decision. The company had had negative results in recent years but orders have resumed this year and the order book is full until February, we even had a very large order recently. It is also a lot of bitterness for the team who during the first lockdown did not stop production and even redoubled their efforts to keep the machines running.

However, nothing to worry about for the moment, replies the Federation of Djonnais traders: ""That there are premises available, it is not surprising, we have always had"", says Matthieu Honnorat, manager. of the Federation. ""We are lucky in Dijon, to be a city which is among those with the lowest rate of vacant premises. We are at less than 50% of the national average"".

The available premises seem particularly plentiful at the moment, but that\'s because they are more noticeable. This is what Matthieu Honnorat explains: ""There are fewer people in the streets, and there are also businesses which are still closed, there are all the restaurateurs who do not have the chance to open"".

This Monday, December 14, the metropolis of Rouen voted to create low emission zones (ZFE) to limit the traffic of the most polluting vehicles. The first Crit\'Air stickers will be introduced from 2021. This ZFE will come into force on the 1st July in a perimeter delimited by interior boulevards of Rouen, and will only concern crit\'air 5 and 4 goods transport vehicles, that is to say heavy goods vehicles over 11.5 years old on that date, diesel light commercial vehicles over 15.5 years old and gasoline light commercial vehicles over 23 three quarters years old.\r\n\r\nDuring future deliberations, it will be ""proposed to consider the expansion"" of the ZFE to 15 municipalities on January 1, 2022, for the same vehicles, then for private vehicles of the same category on July 1, 2022.

But that will never be enough to compensate for the losses recorded in the other sectors. ""In this economic crisis which is weakening an entire sector, large structures are not spared. The wholesaler Metro, in Amiens, recorded a drop in demand of up to 50% for the most affected departments such as the fish market. We nevertheless try to keep all of our products in smaller quantities, explains Reynald Walcart, director of the Amiens warehouse, in order to support our customers who keep an activity. Those, among others, who sell take-out or in delivery and those who adapt their activity. ""There is a slight effect of communicating vessels, underlines the director, with some of our customers who benefit from the closure of restaurants by going to the sandwich shop or snacking."" Not enough, however, to ensure the economic stability of the Amiens warehouse, because here too, the financial loss is substantial and adaptation necessary. Reduced hours, partial activity, reduction of expenses and investments: the wholesaler returns to the pace set up during the first confinement. ""It shouldn\'t last another six months, concludes Reynald Walcart,"" but we remain in solidarity with our customers. The situation is most difficult for them. "" '",False

One month, to the day, after ""the call of November 14"" - a letter sent by 105 mayors to Emmanuel Macron - elected officials renew their appeal. This time, in the form of a ""constructive and colorful"" gathering in front of the National Assembly at 11am with associative jerseys or scarves from sports clubs. Because this Thursday, November 17, the deputies will vote the 2021 finance bill. The elected representatives of disadvantaged neighborhoods want to ensure that the billion euros (or 1% of the 100 billion euros of the recovery plan) promised by the Prime Minister will really be devoted to education, sport, health and urban renewal in the most fragile areas. When our sports clubs die, it is a republican dyke that jumps in our neighborhoods Beno\xeet Jimenez, UDI Mayor of Garges-l\xe8s-Gonesse (95) Beno\xeet Jimenez, 31, will come to demonstrate. He runs one of the poorest municipalities in \xcele-de-France, Garges-l\xe8s-Gonesse, with 45,000 inhabitants. His hobbyhorse: integration through sport. This young mayor of Val-d\'Oise is counting on an amendment of 10 million euros to support sport in working-class neighborhoods. ""With the Covid, our sports clubs are dying: they are losing their licensees and the money provided by local sponsorship. But thanks to educators, sport is often the last bulwark to recover young people who leave the radars."" Many cities, such as Grigny in Essonne or Chanteloup-les-Vignes in Yvelines, have developed their own recipe for supporting young people, through sport, towards professional integration. But this requires solid and lasting financial support to pay coaches in integration into sports associations. Hence the call for help from underprivileged municipalities. So that all the good ideas are shared and multiplied, a ""Grenelle of education and inclusion through sport"" will be organized on February 1, 2021 in Garges-l\xe8s-Gonesse in the Val-d\'Oise. The principle: that each association, each elected official report on its actions in the field which have already borne fruit, as in Grigny where the payment by the town hall and the CAF of a part of the annual contribution made it possible to increase by 40% the number of children registered in sports clubs. In the poorest town of \xcele-de-France, playing sports now costs 50 euros maximum per year and per child. ""The results are already very promising"" rejoices Philippe Rio, PCF mayor of Grigny, who noted as of the implementation of the measure in 2019 a 58% increase in the number of young girls registered in a sports club. Because in our neighborhoods, large families do not have the means to enroll their children in sport. This support must therefore be protected. Philippe Rio, Mayor (PCF) of Grigny (91) In the same constructive logic , the mayors of the ""call of 14 November"" (they are now more than 200 to have signed it) want to launch a ""National Council of solutions"" and meet, if possible, as of February. ""There is such a discrepancy between the emergency, the distress in our neighborhoods, and the slowness of the institutional solutions envisaged, that we have to step up the pace,"" insists the mayor of Grigny. In Chanteloup-les-Vignes, Catherine Arenou very active in this mobilization which brings together mayors of all political stripes, specifies: ""We are not in the confrontation, but in the construction. We are going to involve the local authorities, the associations."" The government and the President of the Republic must understand our urgency. We cannot be satisfied with promises. Catherine Arenou, DVD Mayor of Chanteloup-les-Vignes (78) The mayor of this poor town of Yvelines is very worried about the continuation of the funding of the ANRU, this mechanism of urban renewal. After housing, she wants to renovate public facilities, such as schools, to attract middle classes. ""These projects are also carried out with social integration clauses which have shown their effectiveness as a springboard towards employment. We must not give up."" The Senate unanimously voted for some of the amendments proposed by the mayors of ""l \'November 14 appeal "". The elected representatives of the municipalities hit hard by the health, social and economic crisis are now awaiting the support of deputies. '",False

A first mass outside for his technical teams, since the start of the second confinement. It\'s a rather special Sunday for Father Olivier Ruffray, the rector of the Sanctuary of Lisieux. 250 faithful attend today the mass in the crypt of the basilica, an influx that the places of worship had not known for several weeks, because of the sanitary situation. But in reality, many more will attend the Sunday meeting. The teams of the Lord\'s Day, the oldest program on French television (over 70 years old), arrived on site on Friday to put their cameras there. ""We are all the more happy that we are in a period of deconfinement and that we are authorized to accommodate a few more people, so ultimately to extend the capacity of the basilica to the scale of all those who are watching (the show) "", explains Father Ruffray. On average, the show is watched by 6 to 700,000 people each week. The health situation even boosted the audiences. Easter Mass was watched by 1.7 million viewers last spring, in full confinement. This Sunday is also a bit special for the thirty technicians of the CFRT association (French Radio-Television Committee) which produces Sunday morning religious broadcasts on France 2. It is the first time that they have performed a mass. outside (outside the studio) since the start of the second confinement. A situation both extraordinary and banal. ""A televised mass is always a surprising adventure"", affirms Philippe Vayrac, ""We can say to ourselves: mass is always the same thing so it\'s easy. In fact, it\'s really something different every time because the people are different, the places are different. Each time, you have to compose, to help everyone to be the best they are. live every Sunday for more than 70 years with people who are not from TV, their job is not TV. ""Helping everyone to be the best they are is their job by Philippe Vayrac, in charge of televised lithurgy. He is the intermediary between the technical teams, their constraints, their objectives, and the community that welcomes them, lay and religious, a community that he strives to involve in the production of the program. ""I am sure that you can see the difference between watching TV and living Mass on TV. The adventure in which we are partners, you and us, is to enable all isolated people, the sick but also the people in prison, to live Mass with us. Thank you for your presence and thank you for familiarizing yourself with ten organizational changes, he says to the audience before the service begins. Before taking the antenna, there are still many details to settle. The manager thus comes to express his concern to Philippe Vayrac. ""Tell me, where are they going to go through for communion? Each time, they go from behind and there I have lots of cables."" We must therefore reorganize this highlight of the Mass without forgetting to give some safety instructions to the faithful. ""We are never safe from putting our feet in a light stand or a cable."" Always with a smile. It will also be necessary to repeat the offertory and especially the entrance procession, the chronometer in hand. ""I am trying to see how long the entrance procession takes,"" says Philippe Vayrac, eyes riveted on his cell phone, ""It\'s important for the rhythm. The entrance song allows you to enter a rhythm. This is one of the points that is often repeated before mass. ""Rhythm is essential in television where every second counts. There is a relation to time which is not the same as usual, recognizes Father Olivier Ruffray, Usually, if we need a few more minutes, we take them. Here, we are in 50 minutes, the antenna must be able to be returned within 50 minutes. "" And this duration constitutes a reduced format for a classic mass. So some adjustments are made to fit into the television mold. Communion, one of the strongest and longest of the Mass, is thus shortened. The faithful who could not have received Communion during the service can do so after the exit song. The ceremony is not the only one to know some adjustments. The Lord\'s Day teams adapt to the places that host them and sometimes adapt them to technical requirements. ""Here, we had to remove all a row of benches to be able to install the technical device.

Why thirteen desserts? Because there are thirteen guests at the Last Supper: the twelve apostles and Christ. It was the last meal that Jesus Christ ate with the Twelve Apostles on the eve of his crucifixion. All these desserts are served at the same time and in abundance on the table on Christmas Eve after ""the big supper"" which precedes the midnight mass. They must stay three days on the table and all the guests must taste each of these desserts. They are accompanied by cooked wine in reference to the wine of Christ.

""We are ready"". This is the speech hammered by the French authorities while the Brexit negotiations play yet another extension. ""The state is ready. We have been preparing for all possibilities for three years,"" said Paul-Fran\xe7ois Schira, sub-prefect in charge of Brexit to the prefect of Hauts-de-France, invited to the France 3 set. , This Sunday, December 13. Negotiations for a trade agreement drag on. London and Brussels have decided this afternoon to extend them, this time without setting a deadline, before the final rupture on December 31. Of all the hypotheses, it is that of the ""no-deal"" which seems to be emerging. Boris Johnson once again reiterated that this scenario, despite its heavy consequences on the European and British economies, remained for him the ""most probable"". Particularly feared for its economic consequences, the absence of an agreement was well anticipated according to Paul -Fran\xe7ois Schira, the sub-prefect in charge of Brexit. According to him, uncertainty would reign rather if the European Union and the United Kingdom came to find an agreement by December 31. The conditions of this agreement would then remain secret for a long time and leave little time for the actors to adapt. Otherwise, and therefore in the event of a ""no-deal"", trade with the United Kingdom will be carried out according to the rules provided for by the World Trade Organization (WTO), synonymous with customs duties or quotas. Should we then fear endless traffic jams near the port of Calais? No, answers Jean-Marc Puissesseau, CEO of the ports of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Calais, also invited to Dimanche in politics, on France 3. ""He It is important to clarify that Brexit is not the equivalent of traffic jams or a congested port of Calais. This will bother us of course, there will be customs fees. But everything has been planned. I am not not worried, ""insists the CEO of the ports of Boulogne and Calais. However, there have been heavy traffic jams for heavy goods vehicles in recent weeks, in particular on the A16, between Calais and Dunkirk. According to the sub-prefect Paul-Fran\xe7ois Schira, the explanation is simple and the problem will no longer arise. in a few weeks. ""Companies are stockpiling right now, they are building up their reserves before Brexit for fear of uncertainty. Nevertheless, we expect minor flows during the first half of January. Everyone can then get used to the new rules. will clearly not have big traffic jams even if the flows will be less fluid than before "". New rules will therefore apply from January 1. The authorities encourage companies that have to move goods through the border to anticipate the formalities necessary for export. ""If companies anticipate, 90% of trucks will be able to pass checks without a physical stop at the border"", specifies Paul-Fran\xe7ois Schira. The authorities therefore want to be very reassuring about the flow of goods. However, Brexit should have heavy economic consequences on both sides of the Channel. In this regard, we must make a distinction according to Emanuele Brisley, responsible for business support in Kent in England. ""Large companies are very well prepared, they are only waiting for the details of Brexit. On the other hand, small and medium-sized companies companies are not ready.

This is the story of a Lyon company ""citizen"", built around values. Salads, quiches, ready meals, aperitif break. For 14 years, the Mill has been part of the daily life of many Lyon employees.

When we launched this organization, we were a team of nine people. Today we are 80 employees. "" Tom remembers, but that doesn\'t mean giving up on his principles. The development of the Moulin is based on values. ""For me, the idea was to do simple things, to manufacture everything that we sell and to recreate links across the entire value chain, from the transformation of the raw product to the end customer. create real full-time jobs ... With us, everyone has a permanent contract, whether they are a delivery person or a support function. "" Rather unprecedented at the time, this meeting between fast food and fresh non-frozen products is in tune with the times and is a great success.

Backcountry skiers practicing off-piste are particularly vulnerable. Only for the day of December 13, around 20 avalanches were reported in Savoie, Haute-Savoie and Hautes-Alpes. In this month of December, the snowpack covering the alpine ridges is extremely fragile. ""It snowed little at the start of the season, before heavy snowfall, explains Alain Duclos, guide and expert in snow and avalanches. The snowpack is in"" millefeuille "", that is to say it is stratified and unstable. In addition to this instability, preventive avalanche triggers are less regular due to the closure of alpine ski slopes. The danger is therefore all the greater for ski touring enthusiasts who would like to use closed slopes or decide to go off-piste. ""People will take advantage of it, we must not hide our face, explains Dominique L\xe9tang, director of the National Association for the Study of Snow and Avalanches (ANENA). But they must realize that they can be surprised by accumulations of snow that they have never seen before. This weekend there were many accidents. Remember to prepare for your outings, to take all the necessary information, to equip yourself, to be vigilant to the observables. Also know how to say no and give up. Don\'t forget the basic rules! #Avalanche #ridesafe #vigilance According to him, out of ten pairs of skis currently sold, 8 to 9 are touring skis. ""In the lot, there are people who are beginners. However, you cannot start to ski touring like that, without learning to detect the pitfalls of the mountain"". ""The best sign of avalanche danger is avalanches,"" Alain Duclos sums up. At the moment, no one can ignore the risk of avalanche given the number of reports this weekend. The specialist therefore recommends that cross-country skiers stay on less steep slopes to stay out of danger: ""There is a threshold of 30 degrees to be respected because avalanches do not start from descents of less than 30 degrees"". On the other hand, Dominique L\xe9tang recommends that skiers systematically consult the avalanche risk estimation bulletins issued every day at 4 p.m. by M\xe9t\xe9o France. ""You also have to respect the basic instructions like wearing an avalanche victim detector, having a shovel and a probe in your backpack, adds the director of ANENA. You also have to keep a long distance between skiers. This will not prevent the avalanche but will prevent several people from getting dragged. ""Compliance with this safety rule made it possible to avoid a tragedy this Sunday, as reported by the Data-avalanche site.

The Covid-19 crisis and the closure of ski lifts cut the estimated attendance by 56% compared to the same period last year in these two departments, according to a barometer from the Contours firm for the Savoie Mont-Blanc agency.

The majority of them (48%) remained undecided and 32% had given up their ski vacation. The reasons for not leaving were mainly related to uncertainties about the evolution of health instructions (51%), about available activities (40%) but also to the fear of a third wave (30%). who have decided to leave have often reduced the length of their mountain holidays. Respondents are 43% to have opted for a short stay - from two to five nights. That is ""a proportion twice as high as usual,"" said the Savoie Mont-Blanc agency in a press release. Most of those polled (64%) explain that they opt for a winter sport vacation to ""enjoy good times"" with their loved ones. Among other arguments, holidaymakers put forward the ""good mountain air"" (62%), ""the joys of snow"" (53%) tied with alpine skiing, which will be subscribed to absent from the end-of-year holidays. The closure of the ski lifts for the Christmas holidays resulted in a cancellation of stay for 18% of holidaymakers and a postponement for 33% of them.

To fight against the depletion of certain fish stocks, this Plan recommends, among other things, a reduction in the number of fishing days for trawlers. But for the NGO MeReAct, another solution exists: first of all the findings made by scientists from several countries, including those of the Scientific and Technical Committee of Europe (where France is based Ifremer, IRD ...). Finding rarely disputed by fishermen themselves: 80% of fish stocks have been overexploited in the Mediterranean for more than 35 years, with certain species more particularly affected: thus the tonnage of hake caught in the Gulf of Lion collapsed in a quarter of century. A finding confirmed during one of the last Medits campaigns (with scientists from 18 countries around the Mediterranean) in 2019: In the early 2000s, 2,500 to 3,000 tonnes of hake were landed per year. Today there are only 700 tonnes. And we can estimate that there were almost 5,000 tonnes in the 1980s! Gr\xe9goire Certain, Ifremer researcher - Medits Campaign, and in the hake brought back to the nets, these same scientists hardly come under these ""old adults"" who are the main breeders: the maximum and average age is rather 1 to 2 years maximum. Gr\xe9goire Certain, Ifremer researcher specializing in demersal species (including deep water) such as hake, monkfish, red mullet or even octopus, The indicator is in dark red for hake. So to regenerate the stock, it necessarily requires an imperative decision in the management of the fishery: It is imperative an effort to reduce catches. And thus give the juveniles time to grow. And for a population, the time scale is at least 5 years to feel a real impact.Gr\xe9goire Certain, Ifremer researcher - Medits CampaignTo fight against this overexploitation, there is a reduction in the fishing effort through the number of authorized days. s European decisions, has fallen in recent years: 11,159 days in 2015 reduced to 7,477 in 2019 for trawlers. That\'s a third less in four years And if we compare with the reduction for the entire fishing fleet (134,746 days in 2015 down to 116,818 days in 2019), it\'s only 13% reduction : ""We realize that it is the trawlers that have been impacted the most,"" notes St\xe9phan Beaucher of the NGO Medreact. And to confirm: ""It takes 210 days a year of fishing with a trawler to be profitable, but today most of them only go out 197 days. They are at the limit of their break-even point. ""Hence the angry blow of the profession on December 7, in Port-la-Nouvelle in Aude, explaining that they were at the limit of the number of fishing days authorized for the profitability of the boats and for living. In January last, before confinement, St\xe9phan Beaucher came to present to the fishermen of SATHOAN in S\xe8te the figures of stocks and the proposal of the NGO Medreact: No one disputed that 80% of the current catches were juveniles. But they said, ""We have loans! To which I replied, ""But tomorrow you need more hake and other fish to pay back!"" ""So what solution to provoke a regeneration of stocks if a further reduction in the number of days and trips to sea would jeopardize a fleet and jobs? The MedReAct association recommends instead to work on FRA zones (Fisheries Restricted Areas) , fishing restriction zones. Nine have currently been defined in the Mediterranean, including that of the Gulf of Lion, a rectangle of nearly 2,000 square kilometers located 80 kilometers off S\xe8te, 65 km from Marseille and 140 km from Barcelona. Unfortunately it is the only one. FRA (Fishing Restriction Zone) where bottom trawling has not been prohibited, but only limited to 2008 values.

Cable cars that work, skiers on the slopes and even a groomer that prepares snow ... It almost feels like an Alpine resort that has forgotten the coronavirus.

If he is a ski enthusiast, it is nevertheless ski lifts that the teenager, now aged 15, is passionate about. Even if ""a passion cannot be explained"", Antoine has always been impressed by the gondola lifts and other chairlifts which take to the highest peaks of the Alps. It was in 2015, after another vacation spent in Haute- Savoie, which Antoine started to build, in a meadow behind the family house, in La Bresse, his own miniature station. ""At first, I only had string and a gondola ... and after that it evolved,"" he recalls. Wood for stations, string for cables and cabins bought in stores in toys, little by little, from season to season, the resort ""Les 3 Glaciers"" has grown. Today it has six ski lifts, including reproductions of the Aiguille du Midi, the Funitel de P\xe9clet in Val-Thorens and the Br\xe9vent cable car in Chamonix. To get as close as possible to reality, Antoine worked from photos found on the internet but also from his own observations, especially when he was able to visit the technical installations of the Aiguille du Midi. bluffing: the lifts are working for real and the snow that has fallen in recent days makes the picture even more credible, as evidenced by the videos posted on a page dedicated to its mini-station. The videos shared on social networks have been spotted by the professionals even in the Alps. Very admiring of the work of the teenager, the resort of Val-Torens offered him, a few days ago, a remote-controlled mini-groomer. ""A beautiful Christmas present"" rejoices the young enthusiast. Of course, Antoine regrets the closure of the ski lifts in the real stations because of the pandemic and he hopes their restart as soon as possible. In the meantime, he dreams of expanding his mini-domain: ""I would like to take the Helbronner cable car [which links the Italian resort of Courmayeur to Pointe Helbronner, at 3,500 meters above sea level, Editor\'s note]"", launches he as the next challenge. And after ? Currently in second in Epinal, Antoine aims to move from his native Lorraine to come ""to do a BTS in electrical engineering in Mo\xfbtiers"". Her ultimate dream?

To relaunch its multi-bulk terminal, the Supervisory Board of the port of Le Havre awarded the company Lorany Conseils the concession for the construction and operation of a solid bulk terminal for a period of 20 years. A project that responds to the port's strategy for the development of this booming sector on the Seine axis.\r\nLocated on the south shore of the Grand Canal du Havre, the new terminal will quickly offer development and growth solutions for clinker traffic, and develop the traffic of other types of solid bulk (cereals, minerals, materials). buildings, soil and sediments). The industrial tool developed on a potential surface of 14 hectares will be able to resume activity in summer 2021.The terminal is intended to handle more than 400,000 tonnes of goods from 2021 and exceed one million tonnes of maritime traffic and river from 2031.\r\nA land and sediment reception and reclamation facility is also planned for an annual maritime and river traffic of 270,000 tonnes.

They confirm the cancellation of the derogation from the ban on attacking protected species on the site. Once again, the justice system ruled in favor of the opponents of the project of the gigantic Val Tolosa shopping center, whose establishment was planned in Plaisance- du-Touch, near Toulouse. In two judgments delivered on Tuesday, December 29, 2020, the Bordeaux Administrative Court of Appeal (CAA), seized by three associations (France Nature Environnement Midi-Pyr\xe9n\xe9es, Nature en Occitanie and Non \xe0 Val Tolosa) , confirms the cancellation of two decrees which made it possible to derogate from the ban on attacking protected species on the right-of-way of the site and that of the departmental road 924. In a press release published Tuesday evening, the three associations in question say they are obviously satisfied with this decision, especially since ""a small element of additional satisfaction, the Court follows the reasoning of the associations considering that the RD 924, in its configuration as envisaged in the decree aya initially authorized the project, was closely linked to the service of the Val Tolosa project "". As a result of which the judges, noting beforehand the absence of imperative reason of major public interest of the shopping center also refuse this qualification of major public interest for this road project. This has been the main argument of opponents to the project since its inception in 2005. This shows whether Val Tolosa, formerly called Les Portes de Gascogne, has become a real sea serpent. suffered many appeals and many legal setbacks. Initiated fifteen years ago therefore, the project for a huge shopping center (90,000 m\xb2 of built-up area) planned on the M\xe9nude plateau, in Plaisance-du-Touch, west of Toulouse, has given rise to a public inquiry in 2008, at the end of which a favorable opinion was given by the investigating commissioner. The building permit was granted in 2009, but this is without counting on the environmental associations and residents who are contesting, by all possible means, this establishment. First of all, there is the protection of flora and fauna, for which the impact of the site would not have been sufficiently studied. But there is above all the usefulness of such a commercial area, a usefulness which remains to be demonstrated, according to these opponents very mobilized throughout these years. Supported by the municipality of Plaisance-du-Touch, the project, whose promoters gave hope for the creation of 3,000 direct and indirect jobs, does not meet a ""need"", according to opposing associations. And in 2019, it is the Council of State which proves them right, not considering it as being of major public interest. The argument according to which the Toulouse metropolitan area is already very well endowed with commercial zones has obviously been successful. '",False

J\xe9r\xf4me Truchard, art cutler in St-Savinien in Charente-Maritime, has made it an art object. Its oyster knives are unlike any other and their handles are made from ... recycled oyster shells. In his workshop in St-Savinien, J\xe9r\xf4me Truchard has in a way come full circle by designing oyster knives whose handles are covered with recycled and worked oyster shells, a virtuous loop in the first oyster department in France.\r\nBy imagining this object, the art cutler sought to keep the authentic and natural character of the material. He did not want to make it a sanitized and very smooth product, I wanted that we find this aspect of shell surface, a little rough. I am going to use very specufic bands on my machine which will allow me to have this rough aspect on the handle and then to adopt for the finish just a little oil which has the merit of bringing out the oyster shell. J\xe9r\xf4me Truchard, art cutler in St-Savinien (17) The handle of the knife is made from recycled raw material, as is the case. It is guaranteed to be 100% recycled and can even be used as a hand guard when using the knife. And anyone who has ever opened oysters knows that this protection can be, at times, very useful. ""The Gryph\xe9"" is the name of this oyster knife can therefore, quite rightly, claim to be a totally ""eco-designed"" product. J\xe9rome Truchard has been working with this material, new to him, for a year in the workshop he opened in 2006. Previously, after training in cutlery, jewelry and ironwork, he had worked for three on the construction site of restoration of the Hermione in Rochefort. In one year, he has already produced 200 pieces of his oyster knives, which have met with real commercial success. They are sold directly by the cutler in his workshop or by internet but also in several tourist offices of the department. The project was carried out in collaboration with CyclaB, the circular economy laboratory of the Syndicat Mixte Cyclad which ensures the collection, the processing. and the recovery of household waste in the north-east of Charente-Maritime. CyclaB has set itself the objective of maximizing sustainable and local consumption, and consuming and producing locally. That the material coming from here becomes again objects which are manufactured and sold in our territory.Thierry Galais, CyclaB project manager Special bins have been placed in several cities, they are intended to collect exclusively oyster shells. But in order for these shells to be transformed into a raw material used by artisans, artists and many businesses, they must first be recycled. This is the work of Ovive, a company from P\xe9rigny, specializing in the recycling of shellfish waste. The shells are sorted, dried and crushed. Then, they will be used primarily to feed chickens and other birds, but they are also widely used by gardeners to ward off slugs or amend the soil. They are also found in certain cosmetic products ... and therefore, for the past year, in the knives manufactured by J\xe9r\xf4me Truchard in St-Savinien, not far from the oyster farms of Charente-Maritime.

However, the septuagenarian prefers to be positive when it comes time to take stock.

The Blois-sur-Seille cable car operated until 1983. Today, heritage lovers want to restore it and bring it back to life. Imagine living in the 19th century, in the Jura mountain. You are a farmer, a county milk producer. Twice a day, after milking the cows, the heavy milk ""bouilles"", the cans, have to be brought down to the fruit farm of Blois-sur-Seille. 5 kilometers, 200 meters below, by steep paths. Whatever the weather, or the depth of snow. An exhausting and dangerous job.And then one day, another farmer tells you about what he saw in the Alps ... It\'s a true story, told by Laurent Besan\xe7on, the mayor of Blois sur Seille: producers had done his military service in Grenoble. He had been seduced by the discovery of a cable car that carried loads, stones. He brought the idea back here on his return! Laurent Besan\xe7on, mayor of Blois-sur-Seille (Jura) Until 1893, the seven milk producers of the hamlet of Chaumois-Boivin, on the first plateau of Jura, sent their production to the county fruit farm, located in the village of Blois-sur-Seille. With the help of a cart, they traveled the five kilometers of path that separated them from the cheese factory. Thanks to the brilliant idea of a cable car, brought back from Savoy by one of them, everything changed from of 1893. They join forces to build a milk carrier. They entrust the realization to a craftsman from Saint-Lamain, a town a few kilometers away. It is a small masterpiece of ingenuity, as admiringly admits Jo\xebl Chambard, the president of the association ""Les Wolves of Blois "", the local festival committee. 500 meters between the start and finish of the milk carrier cable car, 200 meters of vertical drop ... and zero energy consumption! There is no motor, it works by gravity. The full basket, from the first tray, made the empty basket rise, that made 200 liters of milk per trip! Jo\xebl Chambard, president of the Blois-sur-Seille festival committee In 1977, Jo\xebl Chambard had shot images of the doorway -milk, which was still working. Here is his film: With a station located on the side of the plateau and a second in the valley, a few meters from the fruit farm, the cable car, simple in its design, but ingenious, allowed morning and evening after milking, to lower, by simple gravitation, a basket loaded with four boils of 50 L of milk each. The second basket, with its empty faces, was pulled up towards the plateau. The milk-carrying cable car ceased to function in 1983, when the Blois-sur-Seille fruit farm closed. The cabins which housed the installations have been restored by the municipality. Today, it is about reviving the installation. The restoration, with securing for public reception, should cost 100,000 euros. A large portion of the funds should come from the communities. The rest will depend on donations.

Last September, nearly 70 left-wing elected officials and environmentalists signed a platform asking the government for a moratorium on the deployment of 5G. Among these elected representatives, several new mayors of large cities, such as Mich\xe8le Rubirola in Marseille, but also Anne Vignot in Besan\xe7on, or Jeanne Barseghian in Strasbourg and Pierre Hurmic in Bordeaux. They asked in particular ""that priority be given to reducing the digital divide through the development of fiber in rural areas and by finalizing the deployment of 4G"". The Citizen\'s Climate Convention, wanted by the President of the Republic, had itself recommended a moratorium on the deployment of 5G. A request curtly rejected by Emmanuel Macron as being ""a return to the oil lamp"". Conseil pour le climat, an independent advisory and assessment body, also wanted by Emmanuel Macron, in turn chooses caution. ""In the absence of a moratorium on 5G making it possible to reassess the decision concerning the frequencies already distributed, the The first application of such an evaluation will have to be the allocation of the next frequency bands for 5G "", writes the HCC in its report.

Already, the HCC considers that 5G is ""likely to significantly increase the carbon footprint of the digital sector"", estimated at 2% of the total footprint in France. This increase is notably due to emissions linked to the manufacture of equipment abroad.\r\nIn its high assessment, the ""carbon impact"" of 5G in 2030 would be linked for a little more than half to terminals (smartphones, computers, etc.), a quarter to infrastructure and a quarter to use. 5G should also lead to an increase in electricity consumption, which in France is largely carbon-free mainly due to nuclear power. Ten times faster than 4G, it should ultimately make it possible to exchange 1000 times more data on networks. The High Council for the Climate recommends integrating commitments on the carbon footprint in the next calls for tenders for future 5G frequencies, and acting on the supply of equipment to reduce the environmental impact. .

EDF admits having had to carry out much heavier work than expected due to a lack of maintenance. The electrician assures however that ""the installation has always been safe"". In front of the few journalists invited to Flamanville this Wednesday, December 16, Patrice Gosset said his relief. After twenty-three months of shutdown, the number 2 reactor started up again, and no incident was reported. ""We did this work to make it work, but when we restart, we always have a little fear. There may be small steam leaks, explains the director of the plant. We had none of this. It is a great satisfaction which enhances the work carried out by EDF staff and external contributors "". D + 2: The production unit n \xb0 2 of the # EDFFlamanville power station was reconnected to the # grid # electric this Saturday, December 12. It is thus completing its third ten-year inspection during which more than 20,000 #maintenance operations were carried out. pic.twitter.com/jHreTkowV0 Reactor number 2 of the power station was delivered in 1986. Every ten years, it must be shut down to check the condition of the installations. This third ten-year inspection since commissioning should normally last six months. Very quickly, it became clear that the deadlines could not be met. ""During unit shutdown, corrosions were observed on the diesel engines (which would ensure the operation and safety of the installation in the event of an incident). We decided to examine the all materials "". The in-depth inspection revealed a few unpleasant surprises. How can this faulty estimate be justified? Today, the director of the Flamanville plant is engaged in an unusual mea culpa. Our view of the installation was not sufficiently precise, not detailed enough, not sufficiently anticipated. Our follow-up in recent years has not been precise enough, not demanding enough. Patrice Gosset, director of the Flamanville nuclear power plant In other words, the teams who watch over the plant have not seen it grow old. They have unconsciously allowed facilities to deteriorate due to lack of vigilance. For a few years, the Nuclear Safety Authority has alerted the country to ""the lack of precautionary culture"". Behind these polite words, the observation is clear: ""ASN has in the past regularly drawn EDF\'s attention to the persistence of maintenance quality defects in too high a number. (...) EDF must therefore learn lessons and strengthen professional rigor in maintenance operations, ""she wrote in her 2019 activity report. In Flamanville, EDF had to carry out work as complex as it was unforeseen in order to absorb corrosion marked on diesel engines and cooling circuits. The plant has also replaced seals that would allow vibrations to be absorbed in the event of an earthquake. EDF has undertaken to carry out the same repairs on reactor number 1, the restart of which is scheduled for early 2021. 20,000 maintenance operations were initially planned during the shutdown of the unit. It was necessary to achieve ""80% more"" ... ""Our installation has always been safe, it has never been dangerous"", hastens to specify the director. Faced with the magnitude of the task, the restart has been repeatedly postponed, and the bill is ultimately steep. This interminable work, spread over twenty-three months, cost 30 million euros, not counting the operating loss. It\'s a lot, but it\'s ultimately not much to operate in full safety. This type of situation must not happen again, insists Patrice Gosset. The teams must look at the installations with more rigor and d acuity to do what you need right away. Better a brushstroke today rather than having to completely renovate an installation in three years ... ""Nuclear professionals have an expression to designate this look precisely sharpened: ""the setting of the eye"". Reactor number 2 returns to service, in stages. ""We were at 130 megawatts on restart. Today we are at 650 megawatts. We will gradually rise to 1300 megawatts until the end of the year"", specifies Patrice Gosset, proud that Flamanville is ""at the rendezvous of the \'winter"". This huge machine ""is in the middle of its potential life, he says enthusiastically. We are capable of still doing as much production as we have already done."" It will still have to be properly maintained. '",True

On the contrary, we would have to create new alternative platforms that would serve the territories. There is a very strong impulse of disapproval because the battle between Amazon and small businesses is largely won by Amazon. For the American company, containment is a boon while small businesses must close with all the difficulties that this implies in terms of turnover and employment. This leads to a very strong sense of injustice.\r\nThis is explained by the effects of networks. The bigger a platform, the more it will attract new consumers. First, we turn to Amazon because we know. And then there is the rating system: since there are a lot of users, there are a lot of product reviews so the customer is sure what he is buying. Then there is ease of use: it is very easy to pay for example. There is also a logistical facility: everything is available and very quickly. With Amazon, we can deliver within 24 hours.\r\nLately, there have been speeches suggesting that the lockdown is allowing Amazon to establish its monopoly. But Amazon already occupied a dominant position [concerning online sales, note]. The solution is not to cut off the food of the big platforms by preventing them from selling such and such a product because in reality we are quite helpless in the face of them. Especially since the regulator always arrives too late: it is very hard to intervene on market logic that is already well established. And then, above all, it penalizes the consumer. Today, it\'s not necessarily cheerful that customers order from Amazon, but if all the small businesses are closed, they sometimes think they just don\'t have a choice. And the platform vs. small business opposition is quite limited since businesses have and will need platforms to sell their services. In fact, we should rather seek to develop alternative forms of platforms.\r\nWe need to develop platforms serving the regions, such as the ""My city, my shopping"" platform [subsidiary of La Poste, note] which is present in several metropolises. It allows traders to benefit from a digital showcase of their offer and to offer click and collect [book a product online and then pick it up from the trader, note] or delivery. And what is interesting is that the intermediaries are the local authorities. It is they who buy for traders the right to benefit from this showcase and it is in their interest since it allows them to keep their traders and maintain the dynamics of the territories. And in this example, the role of the regulator is very important. In addition, if it is the community that connects traders and customers, it is a guarantee of trust. Even if they are criticized, communities have an extremely strong ""trust capital"". '",False

But in the end it was very enriching and very motivating to use the video game medium to teach us notions of computers and electricity. We had fun working.

""Because the monuments we wanted to represent were not side by side in the city. So we had to build a large area. In addition, Poitiers is very hilly, and that made things even more complicated. As a result, we used the topographic surveys provided by the IGN (National Geographic Institute), to respect the proportions of the city and its monuments to the nearest meter. So it is very precise and very faithful. Anthony Sicot, student at the IUT in Electrical Engineering We took out the earth project at the end of the school year, in May 2019, just for the anniversary of the Nautr\xe9 painting of 1619. We presented it to the town hall who absolutely loved it. So our work was presented to the media library during the summer. It was great. Anthony Sicot, Electrical Engineering student at IUT We are not in a realistic representation, to be sure, and the virtual universe is not sufficient on its own. It is the knowledge that everyone has of Poitiers today, combined with Nautr\xe9\'s representation of Poitiers of his time, that makes the stroll very interesting. Fran\xe7ois Lecellier, lecturer at the University of Poitiers The ideal would be to put the modeling directly online, but that would require a very powerful server, and the university has not planned to mobilize such important digital resources specifically for this . The students had therefore recorded a walking video which was visible on the website of the media library. Since Topito has taken it over to exhibit it on his site, people have been contacting us to download the model, and to be able to walk around at their own pace, from their home computers. We are therefore working on a web page that lists all the virtual universes created by our students. Poitiers 1569 is already available for download there, as well as the temple of Angkor, the Gallo-Roman site of Sanxay and some other achievements.Fran\xe7ois Lecellier, lecturer at the University of PoitiersHaving always lived in Poitiers and fan of history, moreover, I already knew the monuments but having modeled them, now when I pass in the streets I see them differently, necessarily. All the more so when I arrive at the Porte de Paris. Where people see the Corbier Tower and walk around, I see the Triangular Castle that went with it, and which no longer exists.

Teleworking is turning our habits upside down and more and more Parisian executives are choosing to settle in the South. Taking the road to the South with some of its employees was essential from the first confinement to Ana\xefs Pr\xe9tot , director of a Parisian start-up specializing in coaching. It was a personal trigger at first. ""In Paris we were 3 in 50 m2 without exterior. In Aix, we are lucky, we have a garden and a much larger area, which we could not afford at all in Paris, explains the young woman. . We have really improved the quality of life and I am experiencing this re-confinement much better. ""Strongly impacted during the first confinement, the shared workspaces ("" coworking ""in English) benefit from the flexibilities of the second version. There are currently around 1,700 in France. ""People come here mainly to telework in a professional setting"", explains Diego Audemard, manager of Caravan Cowork In, which welcomes young entrepreneurs 24/7, in the Jas de Bouffan district, in Aix-en- Provence. There are, according to him, ""two big advantages of coworking: first, the internet connection with guaranteed speeds that allow you to work with the whole world and the working atmosphere.""\n\r\nHe notes that the crisis is profoundly changing working habits. ""We see a rural exodus, of Parisians but also from big cities, and the need for professional workspaces in places that they choose and not that they suffer"".\n\r\nThe health crisis has boosted demand, it is a refuge for teleworkers who do not want, or cannot, set up their office at home. Like Jake, a self-employed person. ""I had to look for a place, it was impossible to work seriously at home and I find it difficult to get into the spirit of work, he admits. I tried during the first confinement, but my son two-year-old was banging on my office door, he knew I was there and I couldn\'t open it, it was difficult for him and for me. ""Here I can chat and see colleagues even if I am not working not directly with them. Jake, freelance worker The young father appreciates having ""a space dedicated to working with office neighbors"" here. ""I could rent an office on my own, but I wouldn\'t see anyone here I can chat and see colleagues even if I don\'t work directly with them.""

Sometimes I welcome the patient, put the epidural on her, find her for delivery, and that\'s it! This is not my conception of this profession. Charline Pierre, midwife at the Pellegrin maternity ward The main demand of the midwives and nursing assistants of Pellegrin is to obtain the creation of a sixth midwife post for the night. Currently, six midwives assisted by five nursing assistants and childcare assistants work in one of the thirteen delivery rooms during the day, but there are only five at night.\n\r\nHowever, the number of night births is almost as high as during the day: in 2020, until October included, 2,627 babies were born during the day, against 2,309 night births. ""The creation of a sixth midwife post for the night, as during the day, is essential to face the explosion of births"" pleads Charline Pierre.\n\r\nThe Ali\xe9nor d\'Aquitaine maternity unit, which is level three, is the regional reference center for the management of pathological pregnancies. Nearly 150 midwives work there, as well as 125 nursing assistants and childcare auxiliaries. In 2010, 5,076 births were registered there.\n\r\nIn recent years, this number has increased to reach an average of 5,500 deliveries per year. And given the increase in the Bordeaux population, the number of births in Pellegrin is set to increase further in the years to come.\n\n Video: midwife Anna Roy\'s appeal to the President of the Republic (Brut) Women are getting better and better informed, and more and more likely to want a physiological childbirth. In this case, they need more time and adapted support, with a lot of reassurance and presence.Maeva Dureau, nursing assistant at the Pellegrin maternity unitGilbert Moudens, from the Sud Sant\xe9 union, who launched the notice strike, has observed for two years that the situation is deteriorating and that the number of alerts is increasing.

Against all expectations and despite the closure of restaurants, sales are generally at the same level as last year thanks to the increase in direct sales in the markets, as has been said a lot. Consumers, who could, had decided to indulge themselves for these 2020 Christmas parties that were unlike any other due to the Covid-19 pandemic. And for many of them, it\'s hard to imagine a Christmas meal without oysters. Accompanied by crepins, seasoned with a shallot vinaigrette, a squeeze of lemon, pepper or just plain, oysters have been present on many festive tables. They delighted amateurs and producers alike, who were very worried before this period. In November, the future seemed gloomy around the clears of the Marennes-Ol\xe9ron basin. With the closure of restaurants and the start of confinement, oyster farmers had been faced with a significant drop in their sales volume. For some, shipments to restaurants, generally via the Rungis market, could represent more than a quarter of their turnover. Last November, the majority of professionals were in a situation of overproduction and feared that they would not be able to sell their production of the year. Today, oyster farmers are relieved and have found a smile again at the end of 2020 which was very chaotic in the Marennes-Ol\xe9ron basin, as elsewhere.

Shipments to supermarkets remained at the same level as last year while direct sales soared with an increase of 20 to 30%, partly offsetting the closure of restaurants. The 2020 results therefore seem globally positive for the president of the Marennes-Ol\xe9ron oyster quality group. Overall, Marennes-Ol\xe9ron sold almost as many oysters as last year, anyway. We have a good track record for market sales, which is very positive. Large-scale distribution stabilized and created ordinary sales flows. But it is the disaster on the traditional market of Rungis and the restaurants but overall we had decent celebrations compared to previous years. Laurent Chiron, president of the quality group of Marennes-Ol\xe9ron oysters The other good news for professionals, c is to have attracted new customers on the occasion of these holidays. Fans and regulars were there of course, but they were not alone. New oyster consumers bought them for the first time or almost and before tasting them they had to learn to open them. A whole art that many had not mastered until then. But don\'t worry, the group of producers from Marennes-Ol\xe9ron came to their aid. Since we couldn\'t eat the oysters in a restaurant, we ate them at home. On the other hand, we had to teach people to open them, that\'s why we made a tutorial on the internet to show how to open an oyster. We must now provide service to consumers.

Fishing is one of the three main blockages in negotiations before the UK leaves the European Union, and if nothing is done, the British will regain control of their exclusive economic zone, which includes territorial waters of our neighbors, in which European fishermen - notably French, Irish and Spanish - fish 760,000 tonnes per year (for a total value of 635 million euros), which is more than the British. The French make 30% of their catches there, and even 90% for the Hauts-de-France trawlers. ""If Brexit passes, I do not see much of the future for me,"" slips Louis Lepr\xeatre, a fisherman bolted. ""I think I will have to recalibrate on another job."" The government is stepping up signs to appease the fishermen. In early December, Jean Castex went to Boulogne-sur-Mer and Calais, where he assured that French fishing would not be ""sacrificed"" on the altar of post-Brexit trade negotiations; also promising a ""support plan"" in the first fishing port in France. Several measures have been proposed to satisfy the British: reduced quotas (60% to 80%) for European boats, or a fee with 15 % to 18% of the amount of catches donated to our neighbors ... To no avail, until now. A lack of agreement could have serious consequences for the ecosystem, recalls the director of the regional fisheries committee Olivier Lepr\xeatre: ""If we all end up in French waters, it is an overexploitation of resources."" And ""fishing to the last fish is not an option because there will be no more reproduction behind. British fishermen also have a lot to lose, because there is still the European market which is very important. The British only consume 30% of their production, so the European market is the first market. If they lose that, it will hurt them very badly. ""However, the idea, among the British, of regaining their Sovereignty at sea was an argument used very early on by pro-Brexits, even though fishing only accounts for 0.1% of the country\'s economy.

From December 22, supporters will be able to vote for their favorite station on Facebook. The adventure stopped at Colmar station: is Strasbourg station the most beautiful station in France? The supporters will have to choose on Facebook. It is one of the stations qualified for the knockout stages of the ""# Plusbellegare2020"" competition organized by the SNCF and will be opposed to the Rouen station. This phase is held from December 22 to 29 at the rate of two battles per day (with a break for the Christmas holidays).

Facing the Breton station of Saint-Brieuc, Colmar did not resist very long with 1,912 votes against 2,146. The third edition of the competition began at the end of November with 32 stations competing. According to SNCF, Strasbourg station owes its first victory to its glass lining. ""Double facade = (almost) x2 more votes. Strasbourg station and its glass lining defeated Chartres station and its 17 meters high: 2,901 votes against 1,076 votes!"", Can be read under the post.

In 1994, a first glass roof already overlooked the historic monument before it was withdrawn. The current dome dates from 2006 and ""makes it possible to reduce solar radiation by 75%. This glass roof is supposed to leave good visibility on the original building, in order to be able to appreciate it from the outside"", indicates the SNCF site which traces the history of Strasbourg station. If it wins its battle against Rouen, the central station will advance to the quarter-finals which will take place from January 4 to 7, 2021.

With its 240,000 hectares of greenery, the National Forest Park between Haute-Marne and Burgundy, is a promising territory in terms of sustainable development and protection of the biodiversity. But economic development is also one of the challenges of the park. This is why the Esprit Parc National brand was launched. A guarantee of attractiveness and eco-responsible commitment, this brand is carried collectively by the national parks of France and the French Biodiversity Office. It is awarded to local products, accommodation sites and cultural sites present on the territory of the park, and which comply with demanding specifications in terms of ecology. The first 24 beneficiaries of this label for the National Forest Park (14 in Haute-Marne and 10 in C\xf4te-d\'Or) were unveiled on December 14, 2020. It looks a lot like company quality audits, explains Jean-Claude Volot, vice-president of the National Forest Park. Applicants submit a dossier, then it is verified that the products are manufactured under correct ecological conditions, that is to say without fertilizers, without chemical fertilizers, without pesticides. The issue of waste disposal is also looked at closely, as well as the disposal of wastewater for accommodation. A whole set of rigorous criteria can be used to award this label or not. The Esprit Parc National brand is a guarantee of quality for consumers and tourists. But the goal is not to make labeled products inaccessible: The goal is to shine the spotlight, to increase the number of sales, but not to inflate prices, specifies Jean-Claude Volot. .

Part of my production is intended for the Maison de Courcelles, which is a place to host discovery classes and summer camps. The other part is sold directly on the farm or through solidarity baskets. According to him, this label will not have much economic impact on his business.

This label is there to highlight a collective approach around the local sector. This National Park, we waited for a little while, we are happy to be able to be part of this brand and to put this logo on our products.

After the administrative closure of the 1st confinement last spring, a mixed season with health restrictions, the administrative re-closure of the 2nd confinement, extended ... We are unable to reopen our doors in 2021 "". It is through this message on social networks that the Pigno family, owner of the Agde aquarium, announced its permanent closure. A decision precipitated by the health crisis even if the small structure had been experiencing some difficulties in considering its future for several years. 4,500 marine animals remain to be transferred to other French aquariums and a dozen employees to support.

Since C\xe9cile Pigno posted her announcement on the internet, there have been many messages of support. As for the threat of closure, accelerated by the Covid crisis, it had hovered over the small Agatha structure for several years. Our premises no longer met the expectations of visitors who are now used to large, hyper-modern aquariums, C\xe9cile Pigno analyzes. ""And we had no possibility of expanding.

And impossible to activate the partial unemployment mechanisms for the technical team who had to continue to take care of the fish and aquariums. Add to that incompressible costs, including 5,000 euros of electricity per month for all the pump, lighting and heating systems of the 30 pools.

Fish and other marine organisms are sold or transferred as well as the equipment, apart from the concrete basins which cannot be dismantled. ""The transfers will begin in the first quarter of 2021. The fish are very fragile and for us it was vital to know that they will be able to travel in complete safety"" explains C\xe9cile Pigno who took over the family business created by her father in 1991 .

Today, the messages of support received from all sides are balm in the heart for his daughters who had took up the torch. ""It\'s a beautiful adventure which comes to an end.

It is therefore they who recover the profits from the sale, for some this represents the equivalent of a 13th month tax-free. The garbage collectors themselves meet as a crew and spend in their sector. They sell their calendars and divide the profits between them. This New Year\'s Eve tradition goes back over 2,000 years. It comes from the Romans, but especially from Tatius, the king of the Sabines. Every first of the year to thank this beloved king, the people would cut branches of verbena for him in a wood dedicated to a deity Strena, goddess of health and strength. The word Etrenne therefore comes from the goddess Strena. Little by little, this tradition was transformed, and the Romans offered dates, figs or even honey, sweets which according to tradition have omen values. Then little by little, these sweets are replaced by larger donations: coins or silver medals. Later, considering this tradition as pagan, the church decides to ban it. But today the tradition still goes on and it is common to give New Years gifts to your postman, janitor, and firefighters to thank them for their work. '",False

This pastor was the regional manager of the Cimade (ecumenical mutual aid association) and the president of Forum R\xe9fugi\xe9s.Pasteur for ten years in a village of the C\xe9vennes, Jean Costil arrived in the Lyon area in 1979.

Surrounded by his relatives, Jean Costil led a final march , against cancer this time, winning him at the age of 78. Christian Delorme: He is first and foremost a friend. Someone with whom I have experienced quite exceptional things, especially in the 1980s. He is really an incarnation of French Protestant culture, of Reformed culture. Rigor, a sense of ethics, of justice. And since yesterday, I remember a lot of things, since the announcement of his death, and I say to myself, but there are a number of people who owe him, especially in the metropolis, to have papers. If you add up the families, that makes thousands of people. What is extraordinary is when he arrived in Lyon in 1979 and began to take responsibility for the Cimade post, he did not know none of those alien questions. He did not have a history in immigration, a militant history in emigration. He invested himself completely precisely because for him, it was a question of justice. And that\'s really what kept him going, all the time, and with incredible results. He was available all the time, all the time, all the time. And all this with an incredible sense of duty. It is rigor. There was in him a sense of modesty. He indulged little in on him. I remember, for example, at La Cimade, one day he received a phone call announcing the death of his father. He puts the phone down and says, ""my father is dead"". He continues the interview with the person he was with and for the rest of the day he pretends nothing has happened. He was not someone who functioned emotionally, and we were very different. And that\'s why he was precious. Of the two great moments that we lived together, with the strike at the end of 1981 against the expulsions of young people and the March for equality of 1983, these events were possible because he was there, because he was there. had a very concrete sense of what to do.

Because overly intelligent people, there is so much going on in their heads all at once that they often have a hard time expressing clearly. I think that\'s a bit like that too, Jean, he was not an orator. Perhaps, but me, it is not primarily the word militant that I retain. It is first and foremost an embodiment of something of Reformed Protestant culture, but which is fading in the country, and it is quite revealing that he wanted to end his days there in the C\xe9vennes, in the Gard, in Protestant land. If, in fact, he was one of the great figures for almost 40 years in Lyon. He dedicated his life, being here in Lyon, to foreigners. La Cimade, with him, was extraordinarily vigorous. Then, he was one of the co-founders of Forum R\xe9fugi\xe9s. Then he got involved, when he was retired, with the prison controller. Finally, he never stopped defending the law.

But recharging infrastructure is not keeping up with this momentum and owners are not yet risking long journeys. At home, Nathalie had a reinforced outlet installed. It will take 10 hours to charge your car and recover 300 km of range. Amply sufficient autonomy: Nathalie only makes daily trips with her electric car. For her, there is no question of going on a trip with this vehicle: you never know if you will find a terminal. It is complicated. Me, I will not try! Nathalie Fraimout, owner of an electric car Yet, Occitanie is one of the regions with the most stations installed. But how many fast terminals? How many stations can charge your car in less than an hour? In the H\xe9rault, the R\xe9v\xe9o public network offers 184 charging stations, but only 13 are fast and mainly in the south of the department. It's hard to go on an adventure with your electric car! Because the charging time depends on the power of electricity delivered by the terminal. For Nathalie's car, the charge will drop from 10 hours on a reinforced domestic outlet of 7 KW / h to half an hour on a fast terminal delivering up to 100 KW / h. But the cost of these ultra-fast terminals is prohibitive at regarding their use The eternal difficulty of adapting supply to demand. Few motorists take the risk of long journeys for lack of terminals and the few existing ones are, therefore, little used and therefore not very profitable! We cannot afford to absorb the cost of installing 30 or 40 terminals overnight. It will be necessary to prioritize the installations according to the expressed needs. Christian Cammal, director of the H\xe9rault Energies union But the situation is likely to change quickly. Between January and May, the number of electric vehicle registrations in Occitania increased by 72% compared to the same period in 2019, or nearly 3,000! To support this momentum, the government therefore wants 100,000 charging points in France by the end of 2021. And rural communities do not intend to stay by the wayside. Pascal Vabre is the mayor of Triadou, he wants a fast terminal in his municipality A terminal in our municipalities, that will provide a service to our citizens, in the same way as a bread distributor Pascal Vabre, mayor of Triadou The network is being done also thanks to the private terminals that can be found for example in supermarkets. There is still the question of recharging your car on the main roads. The Corri-Door network, which made it possible to connect to the highways, was dismantled at the start of the year. The government has announced a budget of  100 million to install fast terminals in all motorway areas. It is also necessary that the socket and your car are compatible ... and that the terminal is free! """,False

In question, the closure of the ski lifts and of the bars and restaurants which plunge these cities into a certain silence: sadness, gloom, spite, even resignation. In Lans-en-Vercors, the atmosphere is not at the party in this month of December. The closure of ski lifts and bars and restaurants, due to the coronavirus pandemic, are linked to this. ""We cannot fit into the festive periods, notes the mayor of the town, Micha\xebl Kraemer. We have snow, but the reservation rate is at half mast. People do not know whether they should go out or not. , if they must be in a happy mood, there is no joy in life. I have never felt that on the station. ""The feeling is shared almost everywhere in Is\xe8re, three days before the start of the Christmas vacation. ""If I told you that morale was high, you wouldn\'t believe me,"" suggests Pierre Balme, deputy mayor of V\xe9nosc - Les Deux Alpes and president of the mayors of the Is\xe8re resorts. In the department, he feels professionals ""demoralized"" in the face of ""a situation that we have never known."" Pierre Balme is worried. In relation to the ski lifts, especially. They will only reopen on January 7 if the country\'s health situation improves. ""We have the impression of having been stigmatized. We were the sacrificed of the moment, like the world of culture. There are a lot of people. incomprehension. ""Pierre Balme Micha\xebl Kraemer even let go that"" ski professionals do not believe ""in a reopening"" on January 7, just like bars and restaurants on January 20 "". These stations have no other solution than to adapt, in the short term. The mayor of Lans-en-Vercors promises that the people who come to his station ""will be very well received, with a smile, by all those who can work"". Those who own a second home should make the trip. ""They will come back to get some fresh air,"" says Micha\xebl Kraemer. Pierre Balme is just as certain. ""They will find freedom in the mountains."" In Lans-en-Vercors, reservations for large lodgings have experienced ""a small acceleration"" over the past two days. Promising. As for activities, no alpine skiing by the end of the year except for high level athletes and young people in clubs. ""The ski club has renewed its reception area for young and old,"" says Micha\xebl Kraemer, whose clientele at the resort is mostly local because it is close to Grenoble. Diversification is therefore needed, with more space. for cross-country skiing, but not only. ""Snowshoes, ski touring, walks, sledding"", quotes Pierre Balme. In Vaujany, its station manager, Pierre-Emmanuel Jacquemet, and his team looked for ""novelties that do not require investment"": discovery behind the scenes of the station (how is done grooming, the production of artificial snow, securing the slopes), initiation into the search for avalanche victims, biathlon for children, dog sledding ... He hopes for 20 to 30% attendance during the holidays. But, the image of Epinal holidays in the mountains will take a hell of a beating without bars and restaurants, often taken by storm after the fatigue of days on the slopes. ""We removed a piece of the"" mountain ""side,"" says Mr. Kraemer. ""We must mourn over this,"" concedes Mr. Balme, who has taken action to promote the use of restaurateurs. ""I tried to bring together tourist residences with restaurateurs, who will deliver several customers in the same area. We are not on click and collect, but on click and home delivery."" In these Is\xe8re resorts, the concern is even more in the medium and long term. ""We are moving forward from day to day. Professionals are working on eggshells, explains the mayor of Lans-en-Vercors since 2014. In the middle of the second week of the All Saints holidays, confinement has fallen on them. It hangs over them. the head of everyone. ""The future lack of international attendance for the coming months should also penalize a resort like Les Deux Alpes, with international customers.""

A militant act Certainly, the church in question is deconsecrated. It acts as an exhibition hall. But for the Lux to go and install a screen there today is as much a snub as it is a way of reconnecting with its roots. This arthouse cinema recalls that it was born sixty years ago ""in a parish hall designed and built by volunteers from the neighborhood and fellow builders under the leadership of an abbot, parish priest of Sainte-Th\xe9r\xe9, located on the same sidewalk. Nowadays, this cinephile landmark no longer maintains any link with the church.

The Lux team noted with a little envy and a lot of sadness that the said church had been able to reopen its doors to celebrate religious ceremonies, ""admittedly to a very limited extent"". The three rooms of the Lux remain plunged in darkness. No moving image brings the darkness to life. The silence is chilling. By deciding not to reopen theaters, cinemas and museums, and by giving priority to businesses - and places of worship - the government offers proof of its disdain for the cultural sector it artificially holds alive with financial infusions and, by weakening future cultural practices, maintains a lasting vegetative state. The Lux cinema team If the cinemas had been able to open this December 15 as hoped, the Lux would have screened Michelangelo, ""the magnificent film by Andrey Konchalovsky "". It is this film which must be screened this Wednesday, December 16 at 4.30 p.m. in the nave of the church of Vieux Saint-Sauveur, in the city center of Caen. Of course, this screening is not open to the public. The gauge is limited to thirty people. It is ""offered in solidarity with all those who bring the arts and culture to life"", the main thing being ""that the screening take place"". And like many cinemas throughout France, the Lux has rekindled its brand this Tuesday evening. A few faithful have come to form a line in front of the door to express their pleasure in sharing this moment before the film, and to express how frustrated and worried they are today. '",False

People do not come because they are locked in their homes, because of age and fear of illness. "" The number of faithful in the church is therefore limited.

A drop in church attendance, combined with the total closure of places of worship during the two confinements, have deprived the parishes of this manna.

A supra-legal bonus was granted to 360 employees. As of Friday morning, employees of Borg Warner, the automotive supplier of Eyrein, near Tulle, doomed to closure in 2022, raised their picket line, in place for four days in front of the factory entrance, satisfied with the envelope released by their employer to finance the PSE, the job protection plan. At stake: 60 million euros. But what will this money be used for? It was the sticking point between management and employees, but the latter ended up obtaining supra-legal compensation, an amount kept confidential, but which is almost the level they were asking for. As its name suggests, the supra-legal indemnity exceeds the termination indemnity provided for by law, this is the case when the collective agreement or the employment contract are more favorable than the provisions of the labor code. 2017, the supra-legal indemnity was part of the demands of the GM&S. But their business was in receivership, and they never got it. They were fired with the minimum required by law. The termination indemnity is calculated according to the employee\'s length of service. The law provides for other indemnities, compensating for the notice of dismissal, and compensating for paid leave. More than the old ""social plan"", the PSE, a job protection plan, compulsory in companies with more than 50 employees since 2002, insists on the reclassification of those made redundant. It is set up when the management of a company invokes, and proves, economic reasons for separating from its employees. Borg Warner employees have obtained redeployment leave. The company can set up various actions, for example to reclassify employees in other sites in France. Impossible in the case of Borg Warner since the Eyrein plant is the only one the group has established in France. It can also provide support for the creation of new activities or the resumption of existing activities by the employees. It can finance training or retraining. The establishment of a reclassification unit is not compulsory, ""but it is strongly recommended"", tells us a lawyer specializing in labor law. And the work department takes this into account to validate or not a PSE.In March 2019, the reclassification unit, set up in the fall of 2017 to support the 156 employees made redundant from the GM&S site, had enabled 67 people to find a employment. Fifty were without solution. To finance these various measures, Borg Warner has therefore put 60 million euros on the table. ""A derisory sum for a large group like this one, which could have saved the factory"", specifies Jean-Louis Borie, the employee\'s lawyer.

General Electric employees in Villeurbanne and Saint-Priest (M\xe9tropole de Lyon) are entering their 4th week of strike against the restructuring project of two divisions in Europe , those of equipment for dams (Hydro) and for electrical networks (Grid), which, for the management, generate significant financial losses. A hard, total strike according to Serge Paolozzi, the central CGT Grid France union representative at General Electric. ""This weekend, the management had the picket line cleaned at the entrance to the Villeurbanne factory, the employees put everything back in place this morning (Monday, December 14) at 6 am"". In its initial version, according to the unions, the plan provided for the elimination of 634 jobs out of 1,989 employees of Grid Solutions France, including 350 on the sites of Villeurbanne and Saint-Priest, near Lyon. Friday 11 December, at the end of a week of discussion at the highest level, between management and inter-union CGT-CFDT-CFE-CGC, the hope of saving a hundred jobs on the sites of Lyon was emerging. ""We proposed to the management, expert in support, to review its copy.

On the social side, the unions\' objective is to obtain more or less the same guarantees as those obtained during the previous PSE (plan protection of employment). If the management has enacted ""age measures"" to limit the use of redundancies, it refuses the unions\' proposal to participate up to a third in the payment of strike days (employees and the ""online strike fund"" -read boxed below - to finance the rest).

A conflict that lasts and puts everyone\'s nerves to the test. As a reminder, on December 1, some 70 employees from GE\'s Villeurbanne and Saint-Priest (Rh\xf4ne) sites, on strike since November 23, went to Paris, where they were received at the Ministry of the Economy before to go to the National Assembly.\r\n\r\nThere, during the rally in front of the Bourbon Palace, Serge Paolozzi explained: ""We are bloodless. We are leaving 18 months of PSE and we are leaving for a new PSE over two years, it is unbearable."" According to the unions, General Electric has cut 3,000 jobs in France since the takeover of Alstom\'s energy branch in 2015, a takeover which was to be accompanied by the creation of 1,000 jobs over three years.

This is the same area now under close surveillance where the first cases were detected: in Benesse and Saint-Geours de Maremne. The slaughter of 3,000 poultry began this Saturday morning In Angresse, the veterinary services began slaughtering this Saturday, October 12: nearly 3,000 poultry, ducks, guinea fowl, chickens and capons. Work that should continue at the beginning of the afternoon. Access to the farm is prohibited and monitored by the gendarmerie. The contamination was detected in a duck force-feeding room during preventive tests now carried out regularly for the farms in the ""protection zone"" (a dozen municipalities) which had been established after the first contaminations. The breeder had however not noticed any sign of mortality among his ducks. For the moment, it does not seem that there is a direct link between this contamination and the two others, although close to 4 to 5 kilometers. Contacted by our team, the young breeder is desperate. It was four days from the end of its production. ducks and capons were to be slaughtered to be sold for and eaten for the holidays. It is the work of 14 weeks that is reduced to nothing.It must be said that his breeding seems representative of what was recommended following the 2017 crisis: almost self-sufficient breeding since he followed the entire chain on his farm: breeding, force-feeding and until slaughter. In addition, being a young breeder, he was trained in all these new protocols that all producers are trying to apply in recent years. On all the batches of his 3000 birds, the virus was only detected in the force-feeding room, but euthanasia is unfortunately the only way to stop the contamination.After slaughter, cleaning and disinfection, he does not know even when he can resume his activity. Through this episode, the whole industry trembles because the epizootic is indeed present.

This acceleration of cases of contamination in farms brings back bad memories to Landes breeders. The sector had already been affected in 2016.The prefecture recalled that ""people by their outfits (clothes, boots ...), vehicle wheels, equipment can be carriers of the virus after having been in contact with birds infected, domestic or wild "".\r\nIt also calls for ""the greatest vigilance of all stakeholders, including breeders, walkers, hunters, private owners of backyards, other bird keepers and veterinarians to do everything possible to protect themselves. against the spread of this virus "".

For weeks, theaters, cinemas, museums and concert halls have been waiting for the green light to reopen on December 15th.

He draws a parallel between places of worship now open and cultural places still closed. Entitled ""Places of worship: no; Places of worship: yes"", his text wields an irony that pierces despair: ""Despite all our prayers, we decide without explanation to get down on our knees, to crucify ourselves, to abandon ourselves"".

From December 19, the tests become mandatory to travel to Corsica for Christmas. In case of control, on the outward journey, only a sworn certificate will be requested. A measure ""improvable"" for Gilles Simeoni who defended the project of Green Pass, more restrictive, last May. The measure was claimed since last May by the executive council of Corsica. Defended by its president, Gilles Simeoni, the Green Pass project provided for the obligation for each passenger to be in possession of a negative screening test for Covid19 less than 72 hours. The objective: to secure the sanitary situation of the island while preserving its tourist attractiveness. Voted by the Corsican Assembly, the device was not voted by the State.

On the ground floor alone, each of the ten entrances is equipped with it. A necessary equipment to monitor the crowds during this period of sanitary restrictions.

These are the lessons of a very comprehensive report which presents an inventory of drug consumption and trafficking in the Lille region in 2019. C\xe9dragir, an association that helps drug users. This report was produced in partnership with the ARS (Regional Health Agency) and is based on a very detailed investigation. The information contained was gathered from multiple sources (users, health professionals, police, justice, etc.). Located in a border area, crossed by major roads and railways, the Lille region is a real European crossroads in terms of drug trafficking according to the study published by C\xe9dragir. Lille is described as a ""transit space"" for products such as cannabis, cocaine, heroin, LSD or ecsatsy. Thus, according to a customs official interviewed by the authors of the report, the majority of seizures in the region concern products that are not directly intended for the Lille market. 80% of the seizures that we make are on the Spain-England or Spain-Netherlands flow, or the reverse Customs source Year after year, this is an observation constantly renewed by C\xe9dragir, drug trafficking is more and more structured. According to the report, the Lille region has a peculiarity, it is home to several large outlets. The sources interviewed in this survey describe ""a high level of structuring (...) and a continual deployment of material and human resources which involves recruiting temporary dealers, outside the district"". ""You have two towers, the one called \'the tower of death\', where they sell cocaine and heroin, and the green tower where they sell cannabis resin.

He wanted to go to the mountains to breed goats. And I was not very keen. EPS teacher, I had my little personal comfort. With our three children, we were quite happy in our house in the middle of nature ""she admits. Until February 11, when her husband discovered the announcement of the sale of the Ferme du Mont Thabor. Almost at the same time, an opportunity arose to sell the family business. To make a decision, they set off to visit the site in the mountains, during an immersion weekend, on the eve of the first confinement.

He discovered this profession and now we do everything ourselves ""For her part, Virginie has made herself available from National Education, at least for a first year. On a daily basis, the roles are well distributed: Benjamin takes care of the herd and the cheese processing.

The Coastal Law requires that the installations on the beaches be light and removable so as not to be present for more than 6 months a year. It is a priori the end of a long struggle. 213 chalets, installed in Bl\xe9riot-Plage, in the commune of Sangatte (Pas-de-Calais), will be destroyed from February 2021. This decision was taken on Thursday December 10 by the town hall. The chalets concerned are no longer in the standards imposed by the Coastal Law and some are degraded. However, the rules provided for by a decree published in 2006 are strict. Beach installations must be light and removable so as not to be present for more than 6 months per year. Also, their size must not exceed 2.5m and they cannot occupy more than 20% of the length of a beach. In Bl\xe9riot-Plage, where the chalets sometimes date from the 1950s, few facilities are up to standard. After February 2021, only 20 chalets in will be kept. ""In a context of climate change and in the face of the risks of marine submersion, it is in the interest of all (operators, users, communities, etc.) to promote removable installations and to ensure the dismantling of installations at the end of the season"" , justifies the Ministry of the Sea on its website. Between the owners and the State, it is a conflict which lasts for several years. The owners received a letter in 2016 asking them to apply the law and therefore to have chalets up to standards, removable and transferable, as of December 31, 2018. Then, in agreement with the State, there was a period moratorium until today for them to apply the measure , indicates Pascal Dubus, the deputy mayor in charge of the coast in the city of Sangatte. The town hall obtained a subsidy of 240,000 euros from the state to evacuate these chalets, according to the Voix du Nord. A page must therefore end at Bl\xe9riot. For their defenders, these chalets are the emblem of the beach and an important part of the heritage of Sangatte. Their demolition is an unthinkable decision for Lo\xefc Lasalle, president of the association of beaver chalets of Bl\xe9riot-Plage. ""Today, telling us that our chalets must be removed because they are dilapidated in order to put new ones back, we don\'t find that logical.

His Christmas show was supposed to bring him 96,000 euros. ""It\'s not going very well,"" begins Charles Lamarche, director of the Cirko Galop company, in Muizon, near Reims. The government\'s decision not to reopen theaters before January is a new blow. ""We expected it. It had been two or three days that we had no more hopes,"" blows he. Since a speech by the Prime Minister on November 24, the government has suggested a reopening of theaters. But these last days, the speeches wanted to be more careful. Until announcing, on December 3, that the conditions were not met for cultural life to resume its course, the Cirko Galop company had planned a Christmas show. The cancellation of the performances is therefore felt as a hard blow because they would have made it possible to replenish the coffers, much weakened by the Covid crisis. In recent months, the company could only live on its professional training activity, the others having all been suspended. For Charles Lamarche, this ""ax"" announced by the government is the ""double penalty"". First from a financial point of view: ""Each show is a creation, you need special effects, manage communication, print posters, flyers, etc. That represents between 5,000 and 8,000 euros. And it\'s been a year. that I am in the red. I had to bring personal funds, around 10,000 euros ... ""In addition to the investments made in a vacuum, the shortfall is extremely important. ""We had scheduled thirty sessions, for an average ticket at 16 euros. With only 200 seats per show, that represents 96,000 euros, at the very least,"" he laments. That\'s a third of their turnover. The other aspect of this double penalty is the personal investment of an entire team. ""Since the announcement of the possible opening of theaters [during the government announcements at the end of November, editor\'s note], we were working every day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m."" To help companies in these situations of financial distress, the State has set up the Emergency Fund for Private Live Entertainment (FUSV). ""I obtained 15% compensation. It is far from covering all the losses,"" he says before qualifying: ""But we are not the only ones."" There is also unemployment. partial, which is, ""in France, an exceptional device"", recognizes Charles Lamarche. This ensured 70% of the salary of the 12 artists. All social contributions have been abolished ... or almost. There remain entertainment holidays, expenses specific to intermittent workers. ""This still represents 20% of gross remuneration"", ie, just for the month of December ""7,000 euros"" at the sole expense of the company. For Charles Lamarche, these charges should be canceled to relieve the entertainment world. ""If this crisis lasts too long, we will have to go out of business,"" he says bitterly. But the business manager still sees a little light in this dark period: ""The shows will be able to resume in the United Kingdom. With drastic conditions, of course, but we will be able to work again at least there"" , he puts into perspective before concluding: ""Sometimes we wonder why we do this job ..."" '",False

While for Bresse AOP poultry producers, morale is not quite good, their inter-professional committee (CIVB) has been keen to organize end-of-year events. The idea is to allow consumers to go all the same to buy ""fine poultry"" because the sector is in great need. There will therefore be four ""exceptional markets"", on December 15, 18, 19 and 20. They will replace the ""Glorieuses"", these poultry competitions traditionally organized in four ""historic"" towns: Bourg-en-Bresse, Louhans, Montrevel-en-Bresse and Pont-de-Vaux.

However, there is no question of doing nothing. Because Bresse AOP poultry are festive products. Most of them have limited slaughter and market dates. The sector is destabilized because the restaurants are closed, and they are big customers in the region. ""We organize ourselves as best we can"", explains Jean-Michel Sibelle. The breeders have mobilized, with varying degrees of success, their networks of poultry, butchers and delicatessens and tried to do more direct sales. Reporting We can therefore understand the importance of these ""exceptional markets"". It is also an opportunity to maintain a tradition of meeting around rare festive products. ""In December, the poultry farmers of Bresse who work all year round also need dynamism, a social bond"", explains Jean-Michel Sibelle.

The truffle, harvested from June to December in Auvergne, is a coveted product to flavor the meals of holidays. However, this year, the conditions were not right to take advantage of it. For several years, heat waves have damaged Auvergne truffle plants.

Every day he walks his plots of land in Saint-Floret (Puy-de-D\xf4me) in search of a few grams of this black gold. Patrick P\xe9ron directly supplies restaurants, such as that of chef Cyrille Zen, in Montpeyroux. This year, for his ""take-out holiday meal"", the chef has to make a sprain.

The harvests were fabulous in the spring, he recalls.\r\nBut the restaurants that were still closed with the first confinement did not benefit from the harvests: ""some forty kilos of truffles have rotted in the ground"" he regrets. The truffles can only be kept for ten days. The time between harvest and consumption should then be as short as possible. At two or three hundred euros per kilo in the spring, the losses in June were a blow to the ten producers in Auvergne, mainly distributed in Allier and Puy-de-D\xf4me.\r\nNone of them can live entirely from this activity, a long-term investment too dependent on weather conditions.

But faced with Chinese competition and the arrival of vaccines against the coronavirus, the market could soon experience a drop in activity. Companies are trying to find solutions; they are preparing for the world after, the one after the pandemic. Mask makers are already trying to anticipate the times when the French will have less need for masks and business will drop dramatically. Already, due to the second lockdown and the prospect of a vaccine, the market is experiencing a certain weakening. But in Sartrouville (Yvelines), this manufacturer has just hired two employees. They are trained on the four machines in the factory. In total, one million masks are produced here every month. The structure launched last July now has around fifteen employees. Kevin Bornheim then put his events business on hold to start producing protective accessories. The company manager is trying to project himself and intends in particular to establish himself among sustainable consumers such as doctors. A reorientation of the activity towards the production of construction masks is also envisaged. You have to know how to adapt to a market that is changing very quickly. ""I think there will be a collapse of French mask producers already. A lot of people have embarked on it without focusing their company for the future. They have bought 50 machines, employed 500 people, are engaged in very large structures. They cannot easily lower their costs. They have a huge fixed cost and so if they sell a little less, they will go out of business "", The founder of KB Medica says Other entrepreneurs seized the opportunity and started producing masks this year. Since March, manufacturers of made in France masks have multiplied. There are now more than 20 of them, as here in V\xe9lizy-Villacoublay (Yvelines). Le Masque Fran\xe7ais was launched in May by Emmanuel Nizard, then director of a consulting firm. The structure, which had to change premises to develop, now has 150 employees and produces 12 million masks per month. In France, 60 million masks are created per week, for a need of 300 million. The concern is that hexagonal masks are facing competition from China, which offers lower quality but more affordable units. Making a mask in France costs 10 cents. Importing one from China represents 6 cents. ""There are people who work for us, whom we have employed. So we gave them a little hope. We are doing everything to give them the maximum hope but at the same time there is an economic equation which means that we are obliged to reduce, and we have no choice because otherwise we are going into the wall "", explains the CEO. One certainty for French manufacturers, with the arrival of the vaccine, there will be no room for everyone. So how to avoid the bankruptcy of manufacturers? All are hoping for a tax on Chinese imports to be put in place to enable them to fight on an equal footing and try to preserve a strategic sector in the event of a pandemic. '",True

A recording for Arte Concert was held on Thursday evening. We were there. ""Baby, baby ..."" The first echoes of a melody resonate, like a song, in the Auditorium Theater of Poitiers (TAP), this Thursday evening, but very quickly interrupted. ""Can we redo the start"", launches Barbara Carlotti? Emblematic figure of the independent French scene, the singer, asked by the TAP to create a tribute to Christophe who died last spring, orchestrates this Bevilacqua Laboratory, such as the TAP and the artist chose to name it. 65 minutes of songs from the Beau bizarre repertoire. Surrounded by Juliette Armanet, Philippe Katerine or even Malik Djoudi, the concert, which was initially supposed to take place in front of the Poitevin audience, but canceled due to health restrictions linked to the Covid 19 pandemic, is finally held under the lens of the cameras d\'Arte, for the program ""Arte Concert"". Against a background of subdued red lights, the musical introduction resumes. Juliette Armanet goes on stage in her off-white tuxedo and sings the first notes of ""Beau bizarre"". The voice is limpid, then withdraws to make room for ample orchestrations. The few privileged spectators (the TAP team, a handful of journalists and elected officials), seated at the top of the bleachers, are on familiar ground. Follow ""Little guy"" with behind the microphone, Malik Djoudi. Barbara Carlotti joins the synth keyboard. In his frail voice, Djoudi sings ""At the end of a corridor a naked woman looks at me. She shouts"" Love, love, love, love, love, love "". In turn, Philippe Katerine sits behind the desk, glasses dark and laughing voice for ""We must dare to do it"", then joined by Barbara Carlotti. The atmosphere on the TAP stage is very calm, almost too polite. Surely the fault of the too short week of rehearsals offered by the residence to Poitiers and the objective of making a success of the televised capture. Yet, from the first notes, each artist appropriates Christophe\'s titles in a singular way. Barbara Carlotti\'s tone of voice immediately dispels any hint of mimicry. Appropriating Christophe\'s repertoire gives a new flight to each title. Each reinvention works wonderfully. Under the clear timbre of Juliette Armanet, ""La Dolce Vita"" on the piano sounds like a song that the singer could have written herself, like an unreleased track. Philippe Katerine and Malik Djoudi return to the stage, one exclaims: ""We\'re stopping. We don\'t have the second text. ""This interruption disturbs the quiet order of the recording and brings like a moment of lightness and relaxation in an atmosphere that has remained very serious in front of the cameras of the equally serious Arte.

It was Dolce Vita, he intones in his high-pitched voice, while the two artists wait for the finds the lyrics sheet for the next song, shadows are activated away from the stage. Barbara Carlotti runs up with the text ""missing."" ""The Lost Heavens"" can begin. Like a miracle, Malik\'s fragile interpretation Djoudi reveals all of Christophe\'s intentions in the grace of the inflections of his voice. Malik Djoudi sings but it is as if it was Christophe that we heard. He is there and suddenly, it is disturbing. Philippe Katerine joins to him, each a verse, alternately, to finish on a recorded echo of Christophe\'s spoken voice. Oh, hey, I wouldn\'t have done that (like that), me.Philippe Katerine, about the beginning of a song by ChristopheBarbara Carlotti then finds himself alone to interpret ""Mal comme"". The song sounds beautifully. We let ourselves be carried away and, like the singer, distracted for a moment. ""Stop, stop. We did it again,"" she said shyly. ""I had a hole, I\'m sorry, really sorry."" And she takes up in her spoken voice the missed piece of words: ""And all at the end of the day, when it declines ... ahhhh!"", She exclaims. Surprisingly, the moments when the artists interrupt the pieces each time bring a little more lightness and abandonment after the recording.The second take is a marvel and promises to be a highlight of this Arte Concert, just like the fragile and stripped down version of the ""Blue Words"" in the voice of Malik Djoudi.

In Brittany, after a digital strike, ""black screen"", the teacher-researchers took to the streets of Brest and Roscoff. Forty demonstrators in Roscoff, a little more in Brest: this Thursday, December 10, the teacher-researchers demonstrated against the ""multiannual research programming law"". In Brest, students are also mobilizing against the vote, at the same time as the law, of a last minute amendment, which creates an offense of obstruction on university campuses. CNRS researchers or doctoral students, they met in Roscoff in front of the statue of Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers, founder of the Roscoff biological station. They covered the statue of the biologist with a tarp, believing that whoever wanted to put science at the service of the greatest number no longer had his place in these places. Debated for a year and a half, the multi-year program project raised the hope of the research world, which sees itself as a disaster-stricken sector. The text voted in November dampened this hope, and the passage at the last minute of an amendment falling within the domain of the master of order, unrelated to the object of the law, provoked anger. In mid-November, the deputies adopted the ""multiannual research programming law"", presented as historic by Minister Fr\xe9d\xe9rique Vidal. The aim was to make up for the backlog in research over the past 20 years by gradually increasing the current budget by 5.8 billion euros over ten years, with the goal of public research reaching symbolically 1% of the product. gross domestic value of France (against 0.8%), considered the brand of developed countries. The government has announced the creation of 5,000 jobs and an upgrading of the careers of researchers.\r\nThe law is criticized for deferring most of the budgetary effort to the following five-year periods, therefore without any real guarantee. It would lack 4 billion euros to reach the famous 1% of GDP. As for the promises of salary increases, they do not allow alignment with the salaries of equivalent public service bodies.\r\nFor academics, supported by students, future lecturers, the effort announced in the direction of research is a sham. And the new ""scientific mission CDI"", supposed to replace the CDD repeatedly, go badly.\r\n""There is a logic of making research more precarious, with money announced for much later, permanent contract assignments which are in fact hidden fixed-term contracts. And the principle of calls for projects [to launch research on a subject ] Is further reinforced in this law. ""Maxime Cadou, law student at UBO and president of the Federation of Student Associations of Western Brittany In fact, if emulation and competition between scientists are a driving force for research, The system of calls for projects also presents perverse effects: fad effects in the selection of projects, rejection of works that go beyond the norm. These are all aspects that have been deplored by certain researchers for several years, including among university department directors. The addition of two controversial provisions in the form of amendments further heightened distrust of the new law. Universities could now directly recruit teacher-researchers without going through national bodies, where other teacher-researchers sit in particular.

At the start of the ""Aubure Basket"" project, association president Daniel Helmstetter wanted to add a weekly market. For this purpose, he had contacted market gardeners as well as the butcher Christophe Adoneth, but in the end, only the latter remained faithful to Aubure, going up every week with his van. The plan to take over the grocery store was discussed with the family. , because there is no question of leaving the butcher\'s shop. But it was the mother, Christel, until now a childminder, who accepted to manage the new store. ""A challenge for me"" she admits.

He wants to break the silence that surrounds occupational diseases in this sector and sees himself as a whistleblower on chemical and biological risks in the composting sector. G\xe9rard Michel, 68, worked for 17 years on the composting sites of the community of agglomerations of the Pays voironnais (Is\xe8re). On Tuesday, December 1, he filed a complaint with the public prosecutor of Grenoble for ""unintentional injuries"" against his former employer. Faced with the press, the complainant denounces the ""amateurism"" of the community and puts warns against the risks to which employees of composting sites are exposed. He has been suffering from increasingly severe pulmonary, ENT and ophthalmological pathologies since 2015. Today, he is considered 34% disabled. ""I had ten expertises concerning these three occupational diseases, it lasted more than five years. It is very heavy, very painful. Psychologically, I am at the end of the line. I would like all this to stop"", he testifies .If he is now retired, G\xe9rard Michel believes that the danger has not been ruled out on composting sites. ""I would like my colleagues who are still in the field to be informed. I noticed that there is a kind of leaden cover (...) We discuss work accidents, but especially not occupational diseases"", remarks the complainant. G\xe9rard Michel started working at the La Buisse composting platform in 2001 as operations manager. He is then responsible for bringing it up to standards for the treatment of green and food waste. The trouble began three years later when he was the subject of a work stoppage for occupational asthma, due to his work environment. The urban community reclassified him by entrusting him with administrative tasks. But he found himself exposed again a few years later, when his employer commissioned him to carry out a study on the implementation of three new co-composting platforms. Green waste is crushed and recycled there to then be used as fertilizer. A manual process that releases particles and gases. ""The most dangerous stage, he recalls, is shredding where it is a question of defibrating the incoming materials from green waste. There is a production of dust and small fungi, including Aspergillus which is a microscopic fungus. It will integrate into the alveoli at the back of our respiratory system. "" Not having benefited from respiratory protection, he considers that his state of health began to deteriorate at that time. And points to the responsibility of the agglomeration. ""My community never wanted to invest in a screen that would have prevented us from wading in this duck pond and being confronted with dust, the dangers that this causes in terms of health "", estimates G\xe9rard Michel who will no longer return to work after a relapse of his occupational disease in 2015. A procedure is underway before the administrative court of Grenoble. The judgment has not yet been rendered, but G\xe9rard Michel hopes to obtain redress. With his complaint to the public prosecutor, he hopes to raise awareness. ""Until this case, we have never been aware of the risks that we put individuals at risk to allow us, to we, to promote this ecology, says his lawyer, Me Herv\xe9 Gerbi. ""The meaning of this criminal action is to find out under what conditions agents are made to work a bit like in the Middle Ages, manually, without individual protection, without a health security policy for operations. of composting "", he adds. Joined by France 3 Alpes, the president of the agglomeration community of the Pays voironnais certifies him that his agents are not exposed to danger. ""Protection exists, preventive measures exist. It is a painful case for Mr. G\xe9rard Michel but it remains an isolated case within the Pays voironnais"", affirms Bruno Cattin. G\xe9rard Michel recognizes that the community has modernized part of its infrastructures like its main site at La Buisse, but it denounces the omerta surrounding occupational diseases.

Toulouse and Montpellier: two metropolises in Occitania monopolize the podium of the most attractive cities in terms of real estate purchase. A ranking published this week by Le Figaro. It relies on sales in older real estate. This market was able to last unlike new, disrupted by the coronavirus crisis. The pink city is 1st place, the Languedoc capital is 3rd behind Annecy, the Venice of the Alps. According to the daily, Toulouse and Montpellier are cities where the goods purchased should gain the most value, where the best added value can be realized on resale. In 5 years, real estate prices have increased by 16% (Toulouse) and 10% (Montpellier). The newspaper was based on several criteria: the dynamism of these cities, the increase in population, the job creation and the real estate market. In this list, N\xeemes is ranked 23rd. Perpignan is at the bottom of the table in 34th place with several downward indicators (number of inhabitants, jobs, price per m2, etc.). However, this ranking must be put into perspective. Because it is fueled in particular by the transactions carried out between June 2019 and 2020. We know that since then, Toulouse has experienced great difficulties in its flagship economic sector, aeronautics and this may have an influence on the future real estate market. Another phenomenon: the renewed interest in medium-sized towns of less than 50,000 inhabitants and in rural departments thanks to the telework effect. In another study published on Thursday, the Notaries of France reveal which destinations are the most popular with Parisians ready to leave the capital. Loz\xe8re and Lot are part of it. Sectors that risk seeing their prices soar in the coming months. Other departments such as Haute-Garonne and Aveyron seem to be less popular with Ile-de-France residents, due to a lack of trains or flights. For their part, the inhabitants of the region continue to invest despite the crisis. Still according to notaries, the share of local buyers increased by 1 point in Occitania in the third quarter of 2020.

Every time he pulled out a book, he addressed it to me with a kind note. Of course, it had to be talked about, the man was a rascal.

A photographer immortalizes the scene and here is Xavier Darcos in the company of this funny parrot pinned in the Figaro.\n\r\nOf course, it would be unfair to summarize Alains career in its extravagant moments. The man was cultured. After brilliant studies, he embarked on freighters to discover the vast world. His travels took him to Japan, then to Africa where he cooperated before finding his path: journalism. Tell everyday stories. He will be a local journalist. For him, the nobility of the profession! In his book ""The Journalist at the Corner of the Street"", he also delivers the funny memories of his profession.

The youth idol climbs aboard his 403 ""decorated with Walt Disney decals."" At the concert site, a zealous member of the festival committee tries to stop the car. ""Look at who\'s sleeping in the back seat instead!"" Alain slips in a playful tone.\n\r\nThe transformation of our professions, the IT that he considered ""domineering"", all upset him a lot.

It ceased its activity in 1998. It is now delivered to demolishers. The city is accelerating its transformation.\r\nBorn in 1938 in Herserange, Jean Noel and has never left his valley of origin on the borders of Meurthe and Moselle north. He began his career as a steelmaker at the Senelle steelworks in Longwy before being hired on the wire train in July 1967. The machinist-assembler was assigned to the department responsible for supplying cooling water to the rolling mill stands. He will stay there until the end of his career. The tours, the nights, the holidays at the factory, he gave more than in his turn. In 1992, he took early retirement and left at age 50 on early retirement. He has fond memories of his life at the factory. It was one of the most modern wire trains in Europe. There was a very good atmosphere among the workers. Herserange's wire, there are all over the world Jean Noel, former machinist at the Wire Train A high-performance installation but condemned by Usinor in full restructuring in the very competitive sector of long products. In 1997, the wire train still employed 313 people but only operated at 55% of its capacity with an annual production of 350,000 tonnes. It closes a year later. The workforce is transferred to the Schifflange wire train in Luxembourg. Jean Noel has a view of his abandoned factory. It is still part of its familiar landscape. Not for long. On this winter's day, her figure is already fading into the mist. The machinist shrugs his shoulders, all the images that matter are in his head, the memory department is full.\r\nFrom the pensioner's balcony, the creaking and groaning of the ironwork at work can be heard intermittently, carried by the wind. The former steelmaker does not nostalgia for a bygone era even if he expresses regret. It was a beautiful installation, there was work. I especially regret for the employment of young people Jean Noel, former machinist at the Train \xe0 fil The 9 hectares of land released will be added to the 28 others already available since the closure of the Soci\xe9t\xe9 du Train Universel de Longwy. The two wastelands will not have the same destination. The local urban plan should classify that of the wire train as a future activity zone for projects that will not see the light of day for 10 or 15 years. It is now a long way from the time of the triumphant iron industry, when Longwy station saw transit, at the height of its activity, 14 million tonnes of steel products manufactured by 25,000 workers.\nDeltam\xe9nagement has acquired the 28 hectares of the site of the former Soci\xe9t\xe9 du Train Universel de Longwy. This developer belongs to the Lingenheld group. It plans to build 360 housing units for frontier workers and their families. A rather wealthy clientele. Herserange quickens his moult to more or less regain his peaceful and verdant face from before the industrial age. The iron and steel installations have, over time, isolated the old village from the commercial city center and working-class districts.\r\nThe city is engaged in a vast renovation operation led by the National Agency for Urban Renovation. in order to restore territorial coherence to the municipality. The idea is to connect the old village with the districts of Landrivaux and Concorde. The viaduct will be destroyed and a vast esplanade fitted out G\xe9rard Didelot, mayor of Herserange According to the mayor, the first pickaxes are expected at the end of 2022. Herserange does not however forget his steel past.\r\nThe Saint Jules bridge, crossed for decades by tens of thousands of workers will be preserved. It is the property of the agglomeration community of Longwy. It funded a study which confirmed its excellent state of preservation. The structure, built in the great tradition of riveted joists, has the double advantage of connecting the future residential area and the golf course of the agglomeration of Longwy.

The prefect announced that he was going to set up a steering committee for this project, which targets 300,000 visitors per year. The project is finally carried by favorable winds. ""Rocher Mistral"", this Proven\xe7al amusement park located on the site of the Ch\xe2teau de La Barben in the Bouches-du-Rh\xf4ne, has reached an important milestone. The prefect of Bouches-du-Rh\xf4ne has decided to launch a steering committee to support this project, France 3 learned on Wednesday, November 18.\n\r\nAn important decision for this project, often compared to the Puy-du-Fou park in Vend\xe9e, and supported since the beginning of the year by the entrepreneur Vianney d\'Alan\xe7on. France 3 comes back in four questions to ""Rocher Mistral"" which targets 300,000 visitors per year. The man behind ""Rocher Mistral"", Vianney d\'Alen\xe7on, sees this project as both heritage, environmental and cultural. He intends to develop live shows inspired by the history of the site and the works of writers and poets such as Fr\xe9d\xe9ric Mistral, Alphonse Daudet, Jean Giono, Marcel Pagnol. These shows and activities will take place in the castle, but also in the gardens and outdoor spaces.\n\r\nThis will be the case in particular for the night show, offered in the form of a stroll in the French gardens, which will tell the story of Provence from the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century.\r\n\n\r\nInstalled on 400 hectares of natural territory, ""Rocher Mistral"" also includes agricultural projects and protection of floral, aromatic and animal species. Following the logic of responsible agroecology, the project is joining in particular the revival plan for pistachio and almond trees, by encouraging the development of a local economy based on short circuits.\n\r\n""Rocher Mistral"" also intends to work in favor of nature, with several partner associations. Thus, the program includes the protection of endangered species such as Bonelli\'s eagle, the commitment to biodiversity, the development of a sustainable agroforestry integrating tree species from Provence.\n\r\nThe artisans of the region are not forgotten. A market is dedicated to them, which will become a village next summer, to present their know-how and their achievements. The large-scale project should generate 200 direct jobs and 200 indirect jobs. It therefore encompasses artisans, but also intermittents in the entertainment industry, landscapers, entrepreneurs as well as the employees of two ESATs in Salon-de-Provence. The village must also host two restaurants by the three-starred Marseille chef G\xe9rald Pass\xe9dat. the ""Rocher Mistral"" project was bogged down in administrative procedures. In its prefectural decree of 23 July, the Regional Directorate for the Environment, Planning and Housing (Dreal) had thus refused to issue, as part of the planning permit, an authorization for a case-by-case study. , instead asking for an impact study, recalls Le Figaro.\n\r\nBut the decision of the prefect of Bouches-du-Rh\xf4ne to launch a steering committee could well accelerate the opening of this park. ""It\'s a great project that needs to receive authorizations and they must be instructed in accordance with a certain number of environmental regulations, for example, explains Christophe Mirmand to France 3. This is why the services put themselves in a position of support for the project leader. "" A decision seen with a good eye by the team of the ""Rocher Mistral"" which estimated that the file had so far been at an impasse. Now, the opening of the site for June 2021 seems quite possible, according to Vianney d\'Alen\xe7on\'s entourage.\n\r\nThe project must also wait for some rehabilitation work on the Ch\xe2teau de la Barben, before seeing the light of day. The walls have suffered the affronts of a millennium. And some of its parts and works are in a degraded condition. With the collaboration of the Architects of France, renovations have already started on the roofs and terraces to put an end to the infiltrations. It is about a young social entrepreneur, Vianney d \'Alen\xe7on, passionate about culture and heritage. He has already developed a project roughly identical to that of Barben, in Auvergne, with the fortress of Saint-Vidal which he acquired four years ago. This history buff was able to mobilize there 300 volunteers rooted in their culture to make it a tourist site, where historical shows are held, served by new technologies.

But it is indeed the series ""The Lady\'s Game"" broadcast since the fall on Netflix, which has skyrocketed sales of wooden chess sets at the Roz de Conli\xe8ge turnery. This is a scenario that the founder in 1959 from the Conli\xe8ge turning plant, Michel Roz, could never have imagined. Managed since 1990 by his daughter, Brigitte Roz, the company has just achieved three months of sales in December, something that had not happened to it for a long time. ""With the first confinement, people wanted to equip themselves with board games, and they looked for"" made in France "", explains Brigitte Roz, president of SAS Tournerie Roz. Our company is therefore raised in the Google referencing, especially since at present we are the last active manufacturers of wooden chess sets in France. "" With the second confinement, the phenomenon was further accentuated. But it is the release on October 23 on the Netflix platform of the American mini-series ""Le Jeu de la dame"" (The Queen\'s Gambit) adapted from the eponymous novel by Walter Tevis published in 1983, which brought this ancestral game back to the foreground. Admittedly, the phenomenon is not recent. In recent years, many clubs have formed around this practice, the origins of which are lost in the East before the 10th century. Some even mix the practices for ""chessboxing"" matches, a mixture of English boxing and chess. The series featuring an orphan prodigy, aged 8 to 22, has been viewed by 62 million people around the world. In France, it has boosted the desire of consumers to own a beautiful artisanal wooden tray.At Les Roz, everything is made by hand. The pieces are carved from boxwood, a smooth and heavy wood, ideal for turning. This is the role of Patrick Bruchon, the husband of Brigitte Roz. He dyes the dark pieces in ""antique"", the light ones being polished. The boss then carries out the filling and felting. Each piece is drilled to insert a steel pellet and thus the ""ballast"", then glued in the middle of hundreds of others on a large sheet of felt. The felt is then cut by hand. ""I cut each piece with scissors because I don\'t like it when the felt doesn\'t perfectly cover the base of the piece"", explains Brigitte Roz. The tournerie thus produces chess sets to Staunton international standards in sizes 00 to 5. Number 5 being by far the most sold, since it is that of official competitions. The set, pieces plus marquetry tray (made in Spain, there is no longer a manufacturer in France), presented in a pretty wooden box made in Jura is sold for around 150 euros. ""This puts us on our site, as in the shops we supply, at roughly the same price as products made in China passed through multiple intermediaries,"" notes the manager. The Roz Turnery fulfilled the hundreds of orders placed for Christmas, until the last days. Currently on vacation, she had no more parts to provide! Manufacturing will resume on January 7. ""This success was totally unexpected! Recognizes Brigitte Roz. And it is difficult to measure its effects over time."" But the artisan wants to be confident in this return to beautiful artisanal and French games. Opitimist, she always has been. Even when in 1994 its biggest customer was bought by Hasbro and Mattel and all orders went to Taiwan. The company had to lay off workers and then turned to other productions: mustard spoons, balls ... It then found a very good customer in the North, where traditional ""taverns"" games are often played. "", but he too turned away overnight from the Jura in 2005 for China. New blow and dismissal of the last employee. Only Patrick Bruchon remains at the machines. Brigitte Roz went to work outside the company for 6 years, but she continued to find new customers, such as Opinel, who were supplied with wooden handles. If she officially retired in 2019, the president still helps her husband ""with less pressure all the same"". I\'ve always been able to do my best, she continues.

The road carriers who contacted him are the same as those who delivered the vaccine to the United States: UPS and Fedex. The manufacturer created his company in 2003. It produces 400 tonnes of dry ice per year. A confidential product, the usefulness of which is nevertheless quite broad. He works for the medical sector and viticulture, much less currently for the events sector, confinement required.

This is especially the first time that we have faced a mass vaccination. The problem of conservation can especially arise for the end of the cold chain and storage, once deliveries have been made. Hospitals and nursing homes will have to have the means to keep these vaccines at minus 78 degrees. But for the moment, Air Cryo Services has not received an order because dry ice is a bit more complicated to store than the Yule log! Even if special packaging exists. Storage is linked to the outside temperature and the fact that the package remains closed. Jean-Marie de Blaecker specifies: ""when handling dry ice, gloves are needed to avoid burning your fingers. You must also be careful because CO2 is a deadly gas, so you shouldn\'t do anything during storage. ""The risk, if the temperature rises and there is a break in the cold chain: the vaccine could become ineffective. Normally, it can still be stored for three days in the refrigerator. '",True

Supporting small towns and promoting their development is the promise made by Prime Minister Jean Castex at the start of his mandate. ""We will accelerate in particular all the projects on the networks which make it possible to structure and develop our territories: deployment of very high speed, modernization of water and sanitation networks, safeguard of small railway lines"", he announced during of his general policy speech to the National Assembly on July 15, 2020. In recent years, small towns have seen their shops and local services disappear. This is why, following on from the ""center-bourg"" experiment carried out since 2014 and the ""city center action"" program launched in 2017, the government is announcing the establishment of the ""Small towns of tomorrow"" program. In France, 1,000 municipalities and intercommunalities have been targeted to be part of this program, including 91 in Hauts-de-France. In detail, 25 municipalities are concerned in the Aisne, 21 in the Somme, 18 in the Pas-de-Calais, 14 in the North and 13 in the Oise. The objective of this program is to give elected officials from municipalities with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants the means to carry out their projects for their city and thus improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. To do this, the State invests 3 billion euros over 6 years, leaving elected officials the opportunity to undertake their own projects in their municipalities. ""It is a real satisfaction to have been chosen by the State, reacts Arnaud Dumontier, mayor (LR) of Pont-Sainte-Maxence in the Oise.

A question of society or of marketing, toys are still available according to the gender of the children. But the trend may be slowly reversing: Christmas is for today. You are surely one of those who will go, at the last minute, to the toy stores in Burgundy. Inside, they are most often classified by gender: girl or boy. A classification well anchored in mentalities and purchasing gestures. But in recent years, things have changed. The separation is becoming less and less clear according to the sex of the child. In some stores, we prefer to classify games by theme than by genre. But this development takes time ... My daughter plays with cars, and my son plays with them at the dinette or with dolls. They asked for it themselves, very young. What shocks me is rather to see certain toy catalogs or certain stores: I remember looking for a truck for my daughter, and I had to go to the ""boys"" section Emilie, a mother of a family. received die hard in this Dijon toy store. Through the shelves, there are still pink dolls, or blue remote control cars. Perhaps this is what makes some parents still balk at gifting toys that are apparently not intended for the child\'s gender, and one of them is Michael. ""At the nursery, my child is familiarized with all the toys, without distinction. It may be a prejudice, but I still prefer to buy him cars or toys for boys"", explains the father. A few streets further on, parents are more in favor of the idea of giving their child toys intended for the opposite sex. My daughter plays with cars, and my son plays with them at the dinette or with dolls. I have no problem there. They asked for it themselves, very young. What shocks me is rather to see certain toy catalogs or certain stores: I remember looking for a truck for my daughter, and I had to go to the ""boys"" section, ""explains Emilie. In general, on the parents\' side, the trend is towards openness. And on the children\'s side, it\'s even more true. The little ones first follow their desires. They don\'t want to know if the toys they like are for girls or for boys. This is the case of Ernestine: on her birthday, the little girl received ""imitation"" toys. She loves to recreate real life scenes. His favorite toys are Playmobil and kits imitating ""DIY tools"". Toys that at first glance seem made for boys. Gauthier also has nothing to do with the separation between toys for girls and toys for boys. Santa Claus must bring him Pok\xe9mon cards. The little boy is not however against the idea of receiving toys seen as being for girls. I wish I had a doll or a kitchen for Christmas. For me, it\'s made for girls, but also for us, enthuses the little boy. The mentalities of customers are changing, and it is gradually the same for toy stores. In the city center of Dijon, there is this toy store that refrains from talking about toys for ""little boy"" or for "" little girl : make way for toys for children . Here, the best sales at Christmas are toys related to the world of cooking. They are made for everyone and have a more neutral color code, explains Christelle, store manager. Her store is part of a chain of stores that have rethought the classification of toys. There is no longer any question of reasoning by gender: we must think about the capacities that toys allow to develop. A toy corresponds to a demand for the development of talent. When parents ask us for advice, we therefore guide them according to the capacities they wish to see developed in their child, such as the experimental approach and ""manipulation"" , explains Catherine de Bleeker, director of Oxybul Eveil & Games. The other point on which the head of the firm insists is the less frequent use of connoted colors. In the subconscious, blue continues to be associated with boys, while pink is associated with girls. From the start, we opted for totally mixed products, with a more neutral color code: green, red or orange, points out the director. The adaptation is done more slowly, in this other great specialized area, near Dijon. The Pic Wic Toys store no longer has a girl\'s toy or boy\'s toy section. ""We made our ranking better '",False

An agreement has been made with the manufacturer of electric bicycles, in receivership since June 2019.The agglomeration of Saint-L\xf4 may see the end of a long judicial soap opera. On December 22, an agreement was reached between the local authority and Mobiky-Tech, a manufacturer of electric bicycles which is having difficulty buying the vast factory that it has occupied since 2016. To reduce the company\'s debts, a judge -commissioner approved the fact that Saint-L\xf4 Agglo remains the owner of the land. To continue its activity - which it has never ceased - Mobiky-Tech will pay monthly rent to the intermunicipal association. ""We are back to a classic relationship between an owner and a tenant, underlines Fabrice Lemazurier, president of Saint-L\xf4 Agglo , visibly delighted. The agreement is suitable for everyone. The Agglomeration is not losing anything, it remains the owner of the goods. For its part, Mobiky-Tech can continue its activity of production of electric bikes, while paying its rent each month. ""Mobiky-Tech will have to pay a rent of 11,476 euros, which is much less than the monthly payments that it initially had to pay to the Agglomeration to own it in 20 years. Saint-L\xf4 Agglo had financed the construction of a new building in 2016 in the Neptune-2 business park, large of 4000 m\xb2 and comprising 250 m\xb2 of offices. The factory was intended for Mobiky-Tech under a seller\'s credit, for a total amount of 5.3 million euros, but soon after its installation, the company found it difficult to meet the monthly payments (29,000 to 22,000 euros) enabling it to become the owner of the premises in 2035. The company begins a judicial reorganization procedure on June 25, 2019. Between January 2016 and August 2019, Mobiky-Tech paid only 240,600 euros on the 625,000 euros of arrears owed to Saint-L\xf4 Agglo and its taxpayers. The company, once again a tenant, must logically pay the sum corresponding to the rents from January 2016 to June 24, 2019, the day before the placement in receivership. This corresponds to approximately 480,000 euros. As she has already paid 240,600 euros to Saint-L\xf4 Agglo, this sum should be deducted from the amount of this total debt. Mobiky-Tech thus owes 239,300 euros to the intermunicipal association. It will be able to pay this amount in three installments, with installments of 79,800 euros to be paid as soon as the lease is established in early 2021, on June 30, 2021 and on December 31, 2021.

The judgment repeats the conclusions issued by the public rapporteur following a further public utility investigation, requested by this same Bordeaux Court of Appeal, and which ended on July 1 in Coussay- Woods. The public rapporteur then explained that the new details on the technical capacities of the project and its financing plan, provided by the SCEA ""Les Nauds"", were satisfactory. The building permits and the operating authorization are therefore found today. hui, in fact, validated.\r\nSince December 2014, the promoter of the farm with 1,200 bull calves, the SCEA ""Les Nauds"" managed by Pierre Liot, a manufacturer of animal feed, and opponents of its construction have multiplied appeals to institutions or the courts. This project, which provides for the installation of livestock buildings and an anaerobic digestion plant, is contested by a group of residents, grouped together within the ASPECT association, (association for the protection and protection of the environment of Coussay -les-Bois and its thermal region), and the elected officials of Coussay-les-Bois.The mayor of Coussay-les-Bois, Michel Favreau, was among the early opponents of this fattening center project in 1,200 young bulls. He explains today that he is not surprised by the judgment of the Administrative Court of Appeal of Bordeaux, as expected because the Court generally follows the conclusions of the public rapporteur. Michel Favreau, mayor of Coussay-les- Bois He indicates that the opponents are waiting today to receive the details of the deliberation of the Bordeaux jurisdiction and that they will then think about the next actions to be taken to oppose the construction of this farm-factory. The group of opponents ""Aspect"" (Association for the protection and protection of the environment) regrets that the Court has ""gone beyond the powers that are its own by substituting its analysis for that of the investigating services of the prefecture"".\r\nHe also indicated his intention to appeal in cassation to the Council of State, and recalled that a separate procedure is pending against the project, before the administrative court of Poitiers.\r\nIn December, the ASPECT association indicated ""its desire to block this project, which no longer corresponds to the current aspirations of citizens, regardless of the decision pronounced in Bordeaux"". For six years, opponents have multiplied demonstrations to denounce the harmful consequences for the environment and for local breeders that this project will entail, according to them. They fear in particular pollution of the water table which supplies the town with drinking water. Elected officials and opponents affirm that it is not an agricultural project but above all an industrial exploitation because the anaerobic digestion unit built next to the three livestock buildings will transport the gas to a factory located in Ch\xe2tellerault and belonging to the company of Pierre Liot. According to the members of the ASPECT association, this Ch\xe2telleraudaise factory does not meet environmental standards today. Michel Favreau, the mayor of the town, had also said that the purpose of this project is above all industrial. According to him, the three sheds housing the young bulls will be intended for, above all, photovoltaics and not breeding.\r\nFor its part, the '",False

In France, the record for the number of registrations was broken in June 2020. This craze among the French for vans, campervans and other motorhomes is boosting the activity of manufacturers, such as the Fleurette factory located in Benet. there is one sector which is doing well in france, it is that of the leisure vehicle, widely acclaimed by the french during the last vacations. New or used, motorhomes, vans and vans have never sold so well. Professionals had already noted a clear increase in sales in 2018 and especially in 2019 but, in 2020, the coronavirus pandemic has boosted the market.\r\nSince the end of the first spring containment, we can even say that it is exploding. Some manufacturers have almost doubled their sales of popular motorhomes and vans.\r\nThe French saw it as a way to go on vacation, in complete safety despite the health crisis. They take some of their home with them and can continue to live according to their own habits. In a period when travel outside the borders is complicated, crisscrossing the roads of France as you wish has seduced many of our fellow citizens. As a result of this booming market, manufacturers of new vehicles are also experiencing a resurgence of 'activity. This is the case with the Fleurette Constructeur company, located in Benet in Vend\xe9e in the heart of the Marais Poitevin. The factory expanded in 2018 and, today, to cope with the surplus of orders, Fleurette is recruiting employees, particularly for the production of furniture.

The clientele is getting younger and the buyers of leisure vehicles are now more in their fifties and no longer 60 to 65 as before. Young people, especially families, are also increasingly likely to be interested. They are seduced by the comfort, autonomy and the feeling of being at home everywhere that this type of vacation can offer them, even if the parking rules decreed by the town halls are increasingly strict. The youngest are turning primarily to vans and vans, whether new or used. Today, campervans represent more than 40% of sales of recreational vehicles, and these customers have to pay substantial sums, tens of thousands of euros for each purchase.

As Christmas approaches, initiatives are multiplying to encourage more local consumption, and therefore more solidarity. Here are four ideas for gifts that will make the difference.Since the start of the health crisis, and with the two successive lockdowns, many companies have had to close their doors, the time to reduce the number of covid19 contaminations. Shops, artisans, galleries, performance halls but also bars, restaurants, cinemas, swimming pools, sports halls. Most of these businesses have received state aid or deferral of charges to deal with their mandatory shutdowns, but often this is not enough to keep the business afloat. While the Christmas period is always synonymous with a leap in consumption, many initiatives have therefore emerged to encourage buyers to do their shopping locally, and thus support professional activities near their homes. While some of these initiatives are private, it is often the local communities that have carried and still carry these projects to promote local businesses in the hearts of consumers. Here are four ways to offer Christmas gifts from local businesses, and put a little solidarity under your tree during this time of health crisis.A publication shared by J\'ach\xe8te en Local (@ jacheteenlocal.fr) If most shops were able to reopen from November 27, 2020, it must be said that the two confinements greatly favored online purchases, by the inability of buyers to move, by the fear they might experience in going to stores, or by the outright closing of stores in the surrounding area. Many online platforms have therefore emerged, often carried to the scale of a city, a department or a region. The idea being, first of all, to counter as much as possible the online platforms of very large distribution and their gigantic stocks. In the Marne and the Aube, the jachetenelocal.fr platform was created by the consular chambers of the two departments, which bring together the chambers of commerce and industry, the chambers of trades and crafts and the chambers of agriculture.

The selling price of  1.70 / kilo in the fall of 2019 fell to  1.20. ""We have benefited from the improvement for 18 months, but it has passed"", notes Paul Auffray, producer and President of the French Pork Institute. If the selling price flirted with 1.70  / kilo in the fall of 2019, a price never reached since 2012, the price has continued to gradually decline. Thursday, during the last listing on the Breton Pork Market (MPB), which serves as a national benchmark, the price stood at 1.201 / kg, the lowest since March 2019 and below production costs (1, 54 / kg, starting from breeding, according to Inaporc, the pig interprofessional organization. ""All the signals are orange,"" confirms Pascal Le Duot, director of the MPB. The only positive element, the current decrease is tempered over time by the good prices observed until September since the average price calculated over the last twelve months (December 1, 2019 to November 30, 2020) still remains at 1.429 / kg. This improvement was largely due to FPA, a disease not transmissible to humans and for which there is no vaccine, which struck China in 2018. The world\'s largest producer was forced to cut down on animals from contaminated farms, reducing its production by nearly a third. But China is also the world\'s largest consumer of pork. To continue supplying its domestic market, it resolved to import more, boosting prices for months. The backlash, the recent discovery of cases of FPA in Germany, the EU\'s largest producer, has destabilized the European market. . ""I am very angry with the Germans: unlike France, they did nothing to protect their farms!"", Accuses Paul Auffray. FPA was detected at the end of October in a second German L\xe4nder, Saxony, after a first case in September in neighboring Brandenburg. A total of some 240 cases confirmed so far, as a result: several extra-European countries, including China, have suspended their imports from Germany. The latter found itself deprived of its main export outlet, China, and fell back on the European market, dragging prices down, in line with the current world price trend. on the European market was added the second confinement in France which took place at the end of October. The latter ""once again deprived businesses of outlets in the out-of-home catering sector (RHD) that the increase in household purchases could not offset"", notes the MPB. Another bad news for French producers, the decimated Chinese herd is in the process of rebuilding, faster than expected. The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, quoted by the agricultural press, reports ""nine consecutive months of growth"" of its pig herd at the end of September. ""We must always be wary of official announcements (...) This is a way of putting pressure on prices "", analyzes Pascal Le Duot. Nevertheless: China has clearly expressed its intention to very quickly regain its level of production before this health crisis, at the deadline of 2022, or even before, and it puts the means there, according to the observers. In this context, ""not easy to make forecasts"" on the prospects which are offered to the producers, notes Paul Auffray, for whom the European market is durably destabilized by the FPA in Germany. ""Given this exceptional situation, between FPA, Covid, evolution of consumption, it is almost impossible to project."" ""What is certain"", adds the president of Ifip, ""is that there still has a huge need for investments in the sector and that current uncertainties do not encourage it "". Especially since ""it will take several years to circumscribe the FPA"". '",False

Delpharm is due to start manufacturing in April 2021 and will produce several tens of millions of doses, the first on the French and European market.\n\n""It is a pride for Delpharm to be the first company selected to produce this vaccine in France,"" said Deputy CEO St\xe9phane Lepeu in a statement.\n\r\nA ""good surprise"" also for the elected officials of the Agglo, already in the confidence for several days of the negotiations kept secret.\r\nThis is great news for the Saint-Remy-sur-Avre site, which is a company that will be able to develop and be proud of. It\'s a breath of fresh air for local jobs. But beyond that, nationally, it is the first laboratory that will produce a vaccine, and with all the depression we are currently experiencing, it\'s like light at the end of the tunnel. So it\'s even better if it\'s done at home. G\xe9rard Sourisseau, president of the Agglo du Pays de Dreux It is no coincidence that this site was chosen among many others in France, according to the president of the Agglomeration. ""I don\'t think there are a lot of laboratories in France that have this capacity for mobilization, and this one is located at the heart of the pharmaceutical production cluster that goes from Normandy to Orl\xe9ans, which brings together 60 companies and a certain know-how "", explains G\xe9rard Sourisseau. The Saint-R\xe9my-sur-Avre laboratory is particularly specialized in the production of drugs for hospitals: ""It is a technological gem of production under freeze-drying and sterile atmosphere"", according to the president of the Agglo.\n\r\nThe company already has a unit capable of directly manufacturing vaccines, but the size of the order, it will have to resize. Nearly 18 million euros should be invested in total by the company, which should also continue its production of non-vaccine drugs.\n\r\nThe agreement should allow Delpharm to recruit 40 to 60 people on its site. The Agglo, in conjunction with the Center-Val de Loire region, should offer Delpharm investment aid, as well as help in recruiting qualified personnel. The process should start very soon, by January, says G\xe9rard Sourisseau.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstablished since 1950, this laboratory nevertheless experienced a difficult phase more than a year ago. In November 2019, the site was bought by the Delpharm group after almost disappearing under Famar. ""Two years ago, we were rather in anguish to know if it was not going to close, and if this technological potential and this human know-how would be perpetuated"", recalls the president of the Agglo.\n\r\nToday, 240 people work on this site for the pharmaceutical subcontractor, which manufactures all kinds of drugs (tablets, syrups, vials, ampoules). Delpharm operates 17 other production sites in Europe and Canada, including 12 in France, including Tours and Orleans, and claims a turnover of 800 million euros.\r\n\n\r\nEstablished since 1950, this laboratory nevertheless experienced a difficult phase more than a year ago.

A white fridge sits on a pallet. ""Solidarity, sharing, donation"", can we read on his door.\r\nInside, leeks, tomatoes, onions, preserves, bread ... Anyone can drop in what they don\'t eat, and take what they lack. All of this can go away in a few hours! Exclaims 32-year-old David Bour. At the origin of this initiative, the young resident of Clermont-l\'H\xe9rault did not expect such a success. It all started at the end of November. Maintenance agent in a gym, put on short-time work, David sees his income fall. Used to ""recuperation"", a practice which consists of extracting food in good condition from the bins of stores, the young man has the idea of depositing the surplus of his collection in front of his door. In simple crates, first. Then, in a refrigerator, given by his friend Etienne Coet, the icy wind blowing through the rue Fr\xe9g\xe8re takes care of keeping the food fresh, because the fridge is not plugged in. Several times a day, David checks that everything remains clean and well-preserved. Each evening, it is in agreement with the management of a nearby supermarket that David collects unsold crates in excellent condition. He also seeks small local businesses. ""You have to see what the stores have to throw away! There, it avoids going through the trash, it is much more hygienic"" At the intersection between financial difficulties and the fight against food waste, envy to share was born. On Facebook, David runs the ""L\'Assiette Vide"" page. A small community has come together around the refrigerator, on social networks as in reality. All passers-by greet David. ""He\'s the new Coluche!"", A teenager throws him from afar. ""He\'s only been in place for two weeks, and it\'s working very well! The inhabitants are participating, they encourage me to continue!"" David Bour, founder of ""L\'Assiette vide"" David is still surprised by the enthusiasm of the inhabitants of the district. ""A lady even offered to cook small dishes and soups. It\'s very generous of her,"" he smiles. Graciously, the graffiti artist Mo came to populate the outside of the fridge with colorful characters. ""It will make people want to stop even more,"" he hopes. Curious, an elderly passer-by stops to chat with the group. ""It\'s a very good initiative! I will come and drop off books"", she promises before leaving. ""We did not think that so many people were in need"", Etienne is surprised. Some people who come from the other side of the city to take or drop off things, it\'s incredible! Etienne Coet, friend of David and member of ""L\'Assiette vide"" Surrounded by their friends, some of whom derive their income from the sleeve, both young people tell of the difficulty in finding work in the region. They themselves have known this fear of the ""empty plate"". ""It was already hard here for everyone, but with the corona, it\'s worse"", breathes Etienne. The demand is such that David has to restock the shelves two to three times a day. Yesterday, when I passed, it was a totally different content, exclaims Etienne. ""So that means that in the neighborhood, people are making small meals ... thanks to sharing! If it smells good, it comes from rue Fr\xe9g\xe8re!"" David and Etienne now want to create an association. Other fridges could be installed in the city. '",False

In question: ""the health risks on the living not evaluated"". Mich\xe8le Rivasi, Euro-MP, says she is ready to go before the Court of Justice of the European Union. They demand from the government a moratorium on the deployment of 5G in France: more than 70 elected officials, including the mayors of large cities like Grenoble, Marseille, Tours or Bordeaux, but also Dieulefit, Montjoux and La Roche-Saint-Secret in Dr\xf4me, are asking for a moratorium on the deployment of 5G technology in France.In a video-conference organized Wednesday, December 2 in the evening since European Parliament, Mich\xe8le Rivasi, Euro-deputy (EELV), is not going round it four ways. ""There is a lack of democratic debate. 5G has not been discussed in Parliament, it is an industrial project that leads us to cyber-surveillance. This poses a problem for society. It is still over. -consumption. We want a democratic debate, and we want to wait for the conclusions of public health organizations.

""There was indeed a study by the International Commission for the Protection against Non-Ionizing Radiation (ICNIRP). But it is full of conflicts of interest, with industrialists and also the American army"" she said. . ""They only take into account thermal effects, which is insufficient."" Patrice Goyaud, physical engineer and administrator of the Robin des Toits association, is relaying scientific work on the limit values of the frequencies used for mobile telephony. 4G exposure is twice that of 3G.\r\nRegarding 5G, here are the recommendations of the ICNIRP, the independent scientific organization: For 5G in 2020, the ICNIRP, the organization which advocates these values of standards and which is extremely attached to the digital industry, recommends double the existing values for frequencies ranging from 1 to 6 GHz. Patrice Goyaud specifies that 5G will be superimposed on existing technologies, ""it will not replace them"".\r\nResult: ""We will find ourselves very quickly with a great strengthening of the electrosmog"".\r\nWhat is electrosmog? The generic term refers to the electromagnetic pollution generated by the technology, but in the future it (5G) may also become a unique and exclusive standard for telecommunications and data transmission. This means that it will perhaps completely replace any wired technology, in particular for example what is called ADSL for high-speed internet. In Switzerland, where 5G is already developed, the measurements carried out by the expert, David Bruno, highlight radiation values, ""3 times higher than those of 4G."" A 5G antenna can cover one million objects per square kilometer. ""And it is estimated that there will be 50 to 100 billion connected objects globally by 2025, or maybe 2030"". The beam is orientable because the antenna follows the connected object in its movements.\r\nPatrice Goyaud also indicates that 6G is already being tested in China, where it is not the objects that are traceable, but the human being himself who would be ""permanently connected"".\n\r\n5G should be installed from 2023 in France, with different bandwidths depending on the areas concerned: Mich\xe8le Rivasi recalls that the World Health Organization has classified electromagnetic radiation as possible carcinogens (a correlation between the intensive use of cell phone and the risk of developing a brain tumor was established by the international study Interphone). ""More and more scientists are worried about the health effects,"" she said: scientific studies on insects have shown a risk of burning on the skin, and effects on the cornea. Finally a British study would show that the leaves of trees could stop ""90% of the waves of 5G. Will it be necessary to cut down all the trees planted in the cities?"" she asks with a touch of irony. ""We must not give up hope"" said the MEP. ""We must mobilize.

A study carried out by the Court of Auditors reveals that the communities absorbed the shock thanks to a comfortable financial situation before the crisis. The future will turn out to be more complicated. In 2019, the finances of Occitan communities were doing quite well. And then the Covid crisis arrived.According to the regional chamber of accounts of Occitanie, in the first half of 2020, 80% of companies were at a standstill and the number of job seekers increased by 22%, while the unemployment rate was 9.6% at the start of 2020, one of the lowest rates for 10 years. Two sectors were particularly affected: To understand the impact of the health crisis on communities, the Court of Auditors has decided to an investigation, on a proposal from the regional chamber of accounts of Occitanie.The magistrates studied 27 communities in our region during the summer of 2020: All these communities were subject to the financial contract with the State, which is now suspended due to the health crisis. Established in 2018, the communities linked to this contract were to limit their operating expenses to + 1.2%.

According to the regional chamber of accounts of Occitanie, the crisis will increase social spending. At the same time, certain revenues will drop considerably: this gives rise to the ""scissor effect"". Taxes linked to the economy, such as the DMTO (the Right of Transfer to Onerous Title, in other words notary fees), are a substantial share of a department\'s revenue.

For example, Airbus recorded a 30% drop in revenue, while Safran estimates the drop in revenue at 44.5% compared to 2019. These declines resulted in the sudden shutdown of production providers.

These late harvests will give rich and sweet wines, very appreciated for festive meals. They are recognizable from the first sip, the late harvests offer sweeter wines, stronger in alcohol and above all very aromatic. Wines for laying down which improve over time. To obtain these precious nectars, the winegrower can count on an ally, botrytis. It is a mold, winegrowers call it noble rot. It covers the grape, accelerates its dehydration, concentrates sugar and above all preserves intense fruit aromas. But the process is delicate, it requires a lot of attention from the winemaker because other molds can take the place of botrytis. Taste-damaging molds. So, before harvesting, the grapes are watched like milk on the fire.\r\nThe botrytised grape technique is ancestral, but in Alsace the mention ""late harvest"" has only been recognized since 1984. The specifications are very strict. The wine must come from the manual harvest of Gewurtztraminer, Pinot Gris, Muscat or Riesling. These grapes must come from a plot of Grands Crus. On the day of harvest, the sugar level of the harvested fruit is checked by a technician from the Alsatian winegrowers association. This rate determines the alcohol potential in the wine; it is strictly regulated.\r\n\r\nTo avoid fraud, the juice leaving the press is checked the next day. The amount of juice should also match the volume of fruit picked. Winemaking can then begin, but it is only after one year of aging that the mention can be granted. All the lots are tasted in order to check that the wines correspond to the selection criteria for late harvests. The bottles can only be marketed after 18 months of storage. The effort devoted to this special wine comes at a price. No less than 20 euros per bottle. For several years, consumers\' taste has turned away from sweet wines, but in Alsace, since the creation of the appellation, the proportion of late harvests has never represented more than 1% of production. A niche market that still has its followers. The product is very popular for the end of year celebrations.

A decision with serious consequences, especially for the sponsors of the boats entered. It's too complicated as we speak because it is a machine which is relatively heavy and we will have to wait. The Vend\xe9e Globe is certainly a village, certainly a start but it is also arrivals so this is where we will have to take a closer look and, of course, we are very open to the various partners and service providers who are all around us.Yves Auvinet, President of the Departmental Council of Vend\xe9e Our assisted awareness rate (percentage of people who say they know a brand presented in a list) is 73%, so we still have room! But, for us, it was above all an opportunity to communicate about our commitments to the environment.

It was in a press release from the CGT that the information was transmitted to the media. Fleury-Michon has just been sentenced by the Tribunal de Grande Instance of La Roche-sur-Yon for inexcusable misconduct following the accident in work of one of his employees. ""On April 09, 2013, an employee of Fleury Michon was the victim of a serious accident in the course of his work. The Fenwick type lifting machine, which he was driving, entered into collision with that of his colleague causing serious injuries to his leg. This accident had as a direct consequence his dismissal for unfitness for any position. "" says the press release. ""Today, he is fighting not to have his leg amputated"" adds Franck Cr\xe9peau, union delegate and secretary of the CGT Fleury-Michon. Already in June 2019, the criminal court of La Roche-sur-Yon had declared Fleury Michon guilty on the count of ""involuntary injuries by legal person with disability greater than 3 months in the course of work"". The court had established that the width of the traffic corridor was not suitable for the passage of two pallet trucks and that the area was very congested. The judgment pointed out that ""the employer was aware of these risks. Risks reported during a CHSCT meeting on March 12, 2013."" Following this first decision, the injured employee seized the social division of the Tribunal de Grande Instance to have the inexcusable fault of the employer recognized in order to obtain compensation for the damages suffered. By its decision rendered on November 13, 2020, the high court recognized the inexcusable fault of the employer, by confirming the decision of the criminal court. The court also ordered a medical expertise in order to quantify the various damages suffered by the employee which will be borne by the company. For the CGT, ""this decision is important for the employee who since this accident has been seriously disabled. The consequences on his life are very heavy, both physically and morally. If the management of the company had followed the recommendations of its elected officials at the CHSCT , this accident could have been avoided. In its press release the union affirms that the management has learned nothing from this tragedy. Read CGT on the current working conditions in the workshops, the management, without any scruples, continued to dangerously expose the health of the workers for its own benefit. ""Management had until December 13 to appeal the decision. She did not do so and therefore takes note of the court\'s decision. '",True

One of the three major market operators, Transdev, is actively preparing to conquer these markets. We asked Brice Bohuon, Deputy Managing Director of Transdev France, three questions. It\'s a real revolution in the world of public transport: the end of monopolies in the operation of all bus lines and in the rail sector. In \xcele-de-France, the schedule was specified by Ile-de-France Mobilit\xe9s, the region\'s transport union. From 2021, the lines of the Optile network will be open to competition. This network includes more than 1,200 lines in the outer suburbs. These lines were managed by different operators and the contracts were concluded by mutual agreement (Transdev operates more than half of them). Everything has now been redesigned. Railways are also concerned, first of all trams with two lines open to competition at the end of 2023. Three questions to Brice Bohuon, Deputy CEO of Transdev France in charge of \xcele-de-France and rail. Opening up to competition is a complete challenge. The networks that we operate today, it is not at all written that we will continue to operate them tomorrow. We have to prove to \xcele-de-France Mobilit\xe9s that we are the best operator they can choose to operate the networks in the future. On the first batches, as we have seen, there is serious competition. \xcele-de-France, when you use public transport, is a very special territory. There is strong demographic growth, strong growth in mobility. We do urban transport, in the cities. But also interurban, from pole to pole on national roads since we are talking about the outer ring. And then school transport. Working in \xcele-de-France is obviously contracts that everyone is tearing off. From this point of view, the competition is fierce. This has a virtue, it forces us to surpass ourselves but I can guarantee you that the competition is severe.We feel relevant and legitimate on most or even all of the calls for tenders that \xcele-de-France Mobilit\xe9s is in. throwing or launched. We have a fairly pragmatic approach and we will respond when we know that we can bring added value to \xcele-de-France Mobilit\xe9s. Overall, given the place we have today in bus networks, we know that we can provide innovative solutions and quality of service on all batches. IDF Mobilit\xe9s yesterday announced Q11 and Q4 as the first potential lots. Seen from the plane, this corresponds to a thoughtful opening up to competition. These are lines with an isolated workshop and this will allow the new entrant to have an integrated approach to railway operations. It is a key element for us. We cannot do maintenance if it is not totally linked to operation.When we talk about RER or Transilien lines, it is mass transit taken to the extreme and therefore there is expertise extremely strong to have. Each call for tenders must be reviewed. Transdev can have an added value proposition. There are three reasons why there is a drop in attendance: the continuation of teleworking, the use of soft modes (cycling, walking in town centers) and a revival in car power. We see in the surveys that there is a concern that is largely unwarranted. When you look at the figures from the health authorities, less than 1% of the clusters are connected to public transport. When you dig, these are deviant behaviors such as no wearing a mask in an unventilated bus. I hope that over time, travelers will realize that in any public transport vehicle, with the mask and all the measures that we put in place, there are no risks . All our vehicles are disinfected at least once a day with virucidal mechanisms. If we look at the way public transport works with a little objectivity, this is not where we take risks. '",False

And both seem persistent about a positive outcome for both parties. The prospect of a ""no-deal"" seems more than ever inevitable. And among the stumbling blocks to a possible trade agreement between the two sides of the Channel, fishing is prominent. The subject is crucial for several Member States (France, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland) whose fishermen want to keep access to British waters, which are full of fish. The UK government has already taken the lead in mobilizing the Royal Navy, and four 80-meter-long vessels have been put on standby to prevent EU trawlers from entering UK waters if they do not. There is no new agreement on fishing rights. For now, the United Kingdom, which left the EU on January 31, 2020, continues to comply with European rules during a transition period that ends on December 31.

This Thursday, December 17, before the opening of the municipal council, Gr\xe9gory Doucet (EELV) recalled that Lyon ""was still a little far"" from a quarter of housing social security provisions provided for by the Duflot law. According to the city councilor, Lyon now has 21.5% of social housing against 17.72% in 2001.
